If you haven't passed the pregnancy yet, there are three ways to deal with a pregnancy loss: you can "watch and wait," giving your body time to pass the pregnancy on its own; you can take pills to help pass the pregnancy; or your provider can do a procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue from your uterus.

Once you have had a miscarriage, it's possible to get pregnant again right away. If you aren't interested in getting pregnant, it's okay to start a birth control method right away.`,

We got so many questions about pregnancy scares in the comments of the original “Um, can I get pregnant if…?” that we decided it was time for part 2.  

Last time we talked about specific sex acts that could lead to pregnancy—this time we’re talking about the chance of pregnancy in various circumstances.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if I was drunk or high when we had sex?</b><br><br>

Yes! Being drunk or high when you have sex has nothing to do with the biological chances of getting pregnant.  

Since being intoxicated makes you or your partner less likely to remember protection (like condoms or pills), it may actually increase your risk of pregnancy.  

If alcohol or drug use is part of your regular routine, consider using a birth control method that doesn’t require daily memory—like the implant, IUD, or shot—or double up with condoms and another method.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if we’ve been having sex without birth control and haven’t gotten pregnant yet? Maybe I’m infertile.</b><br><br>

Up to 1 in 6 young people believe they may never be able to get pregnant or get someone pregnant.  

In reality, most are fertile.  

Having sex without birth control and not getting pregnant just means you got lucky—not that you’re infertile.  

You may get lucky a few times, but that doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. 95 out of 100 young people who have penis-in-vagina sex at least once a week get pregnant within a year.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if I had an STI when we had sex?</b><br><br>

Having an STI like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis doesn’t change the chance of pregnancy. Sperm still swim, and STIs don’t stop the egg from doing its thing.  

However, repeated or untreated STIs can cause damage over time—scar tissue in the fallopian tubes, for example—which can increase your chance of infertility.  

That’s why health care providers recommend annual STI testing for people with a cervix under age 25.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if I’ve been raped?</b><br><br>

Yes. There is no biological mechanism that prevents pregnancy from rape.  

It’s a harmful myth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has clearly stated: you can’t control when your body releases an egg, whether it gets fertilized, or whether it implants.  

It doesn’t matter whether it’s rape or consensual sex.  

If someone forces you to have sex without your consent—it’s rape. If you say “stop” and they don’t—it’s rape.  

Being raped is NEVER your fault. If you need support, contact RAINN.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if my partner masturbated before we had sex?</b><br><br>

Yes. Masturbating earlier in the day or even multiple times doesn’t lower sperm count enough to prevent pregnancy.  

Studies show sperm count remains in the normal range even with repeated ejaculation. The average person with testes makes 45–200 million sperm per day—plenty for pregnancy to occur.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if I just stopped using a hormonal method like the pill (or patch, or ring, or IUD, or implant)? Doesn’t my body need to readjust first?</b><br><br>

Nope. You can get pregnant right away after stopping most hormonal methods.  

It doesn’t matter if you used them for months or years—your fertility returns as soon as you stop. That’s why it’s important to switch to another method right away if you want to avoid pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>One exception: the shot.</b><br><br>

It’s designed to last 3 months, but for some people, it may take up to 10 months to get pregnant after the last shot.  

Some people get pregnant the month they stop using birth control—others take longer. Once you stop, it’s open season to get pregnant.<br><br>

Had unprotected sex and now you’re worried?  

If it’s been less than 5 days, consider emergency contraception.<br><br>

Pregnancy scares: most people have one at some point. Even when you know how pregnancy happens, most textbooks don’t cover what specific sex acts could result in pregnancy.  

So let’s talk details…<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if there was no penetration?</b><br><br>

Yes. Sperm are very efficient swimmers. Anytime semen gets on or near your vulva—even without penetration—there is a chance of pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if I have sex right before, right after, or during my period?</b><br><br>

Yes, yes, and yes.  

You’re most likely to get pregnant during ovulation, which usually happens 12–16 days after your period starts.  

But ovulation can be unpredictable, and sperm can survive in the body for several days.  

So sex at any point in your cycle could lead to pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant if my clothes were on?</b><br><br>

No. Sperm cannot swim through clothing.  

Dry humping—sex where clothes are fully on—does not cause pregnancy.  

Also, sperm exposed to air lose mobility quickly and can’t survive for long.  

Touching or wearing clothes with dried semen does not lead to pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>What if he fingered me and there was semen or pre-cum on his fingers?</b><br><br>

Yes, pregnancy is possible.  

If sperm (including from pre-cum) gets into the vagina by any method, pregnancy can occur.  

Pre-cum may contain sperm, even though it’s in smaller amounts than full ejaculation.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant from sex toys?</b><br><br>

Only if semen is on the toy and it enters your vagina.  

If sperm is present and enters the body, pregnancy is possible—even if it’s via a toy.<br><br>

<b>What if I have sex in a pool or hot tub?</b><br><br>

You can still get pregnant if you have penis-in-vagina sex in a pool or hot tub.  

The water itself doesn’t prevent sperm from reaching the egg.  

While chlorine or heat may kill sperm in the water, they do not affect sperm that’s inside the body.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant from oral sex? Anal sex?</b><br><br>

No.  

Pregnancy requires sperm to enter the vagina.  

The mouth and anus are not connected to the uterus or reproductive system.  

However, semen dripping from the anus to the vulva could pose a risk if it enters the vagina.<br><br>

<b>Do you have to have an orgasm to get pregnant?</b><br><br>

No. Orgasm has no effect on ovulation or the ability to conceive.  

Pregnancy can happen even if no one orgasms.<br><br>

<b>I had sex standing up, so won’t gravity stop the sperm from swimming?</b><br><br>

Nope. Sperm can swim in any direction—up, down, sideways.  

Gravity does not prevent pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>I had unprotected sex, and I’m worried about pregnancy.</b><br><br>

If it’s been less than 5 days, consider emergency contraception (EC).  

Options include:
- EC pills (some are available over the counter)
- Hormonal or copper IUDs  

EC helps prevent pregnancy before it starts. It is not the same as abortion pills.<br><br>

<b>What if it’s been more than 5 days?</b><br><br>

Take a pregnancy test.  

You can buy one from most drug stores or get tested at a local clinic.  

For best results, wait at least 1 week after sex, or test a few days after your expected period.<br><br>

<b>Is there anything else I should watch out for with unprotected sex?</b><br><br>

Yes. Infections.  

Unprotected sex increases the risk of STIs, which can affect future fertility.  

Use barrier methods (like condoms), or explore options like PrEP or PEP for HIV protection.<br><br>

<b>Still have questions?</b><br><br>

We do our best to respond to comments, but if your question is already answered in this article, we may not repeat it.  

If you have an urgent concern, call the Sex, Gender, and Relationships (SGR) Hotline at 415-989-7374 or talk to a health care provider.

Congratulations! You just found out your bestie is pregnant and planning to parent, and that means you’re about to be an honorary auntie!  

However, there are ten (yes, ten) months in a pregnancy before the baby arrives, and your friend will need your support while baking a bun in the oven.  

What is the best way to help when someone you love is pregnant? Every pregnancy is different, so any advice on how to be there for a pregnant person should be tweaked to fit them best.  

Get ready for your auntie era, bb. It’s going to be the best!<br><br>

<b>1. Be a good listener</b><br><br>

Sure, being a good listener is Friendship 101, but pregnancy is a whole new ball game.  

Your BFF may go through a range of emotions after discovering the pregnancy. They might feel joy, fear, stress—or even change their mind about continuing the pregnancy.  

What helps? Listening. Let them process without judgment.<br><br>

<b>2. Go to prenatal appointments with them</b><br><br>

Not every pregnancy starts the same way—and not everyone has a partner to attend doctor visits.  

Ask your BFF if they’d like company. Just being there matters more than you know.<br><br>

<b>3. Organize and throw a baby shower</b><br><br>

Baby showers are your time to shine!  

Coordinate with their family or chosen family to celebrate the new arrival.  

Ask your friend for input on the guest list and theme. Make it their vibe.<br><br>

<b>4. Buy them a coveted baby item</b><br><br>

When your friend casually mentions a dream baby item—listen closely.  

Then surprise them with it. Thoughtful timing turns a gift into a memory.<br><br>

<b>5. Ask them how they feel about outings</b><br><br>

Don’t assume your pregnant friend wants to stay home.  

Just ask: “Do you want to come?”  

Let them decide based on how they feel that day.<br><br>

<b>6. Be their advocate</b><br><br>

If your BFF wants you in the delivery room—wow, that’s major.  

But it’s not just for moral support.  

Birth is intense. Be the person who speaks up, keeps them calm, and respects their birth plan. Talk through it all in advance.<br><br>

<b>7. Do something special for your BFF that’s unrelated to the baby</b><br><br>

Everyone’s focused on the baby—but don’t forget your friend.  

Do something just for them: a spa day, a favorite meal, a creative date.  

Remind them they are still themselves beyond the pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>8. Pledge your undying love and support for all eternity</b><br><br>

Okay maybe you’ve already done that.  

But now, you’re stepping up in a new way.  

Let them know you’re part of their baby’s village—babysitting, emergency contact, late-night calls.  

Being present now will mean the world, during pregnancy and beyond.<br><br>

Prepping for auntie life is a big job, but there’s no better person than you to do it.

When you're focused on trying to prevent pregnancy, it’s easy to overlook what it's like for someone who's trying to conceive (TTC).  

You may have only seen TTC on TV—timed sex, temperature checks, and awkward party bathroom runs. But in real life, TTC can be complex, lengthy, emotional, and involve a whole team of support people.  

Globally, about 1 in 6 people experience infertility. In the U.S., about 4 in 10 use some kind of assistance to conceive—whether it's meds, IVF, IUI, donor sperm or eggs, or surgical procedures.  

Despite how common this journey is, it’s not often talked about. That can make it hard to know how to support someone you love. Here’s how you can show up for them—especially if they’re from communities that face barriers to fertility treatment and support.<br><br>

<b>1. Ask your loved one how to best support them.</b><br><br>

Everyone's journey is different. Don’t guess—ask.  

Start by checking in on what kind of support they need. Be ready with ideas, but let them lead.<br><br>

<b>2. Validate their feelings.</b><br><br>

The TTC journey can bring a mix of emotions: joy, fear, grief, hope—and sometimes all at once.  

Let them feel what they feel. Listen actively. Acknowledge their emotions. Offer empathy, not fixes.<br><br>

<b>3. Help create self-care plans (and if you're their partner, make one too).</b><br><br>

Trying to conceive can be draining—physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially.  

Help them plan ways to restore themselves.  

That could mean:
- Low-cost comforts like their favorite snacks or movies  
- Rituals to honor moments in the process (like self-care after a negative test)  
- Setting boundaries with others—and you can help them uphold those too<br><br>

<b>4. Avoid certain questions and phrases.</b><br><br>

Things not to say:
- “Are you pregnant yet?”
- “When do you think it’ll happen?”
- “Once you relax, it’ll happen.”
- Any unsolicited advice or clichés  

Even if well-meaning, these can feel dismissive or hurtful.<br><br>

<b>5. Offer to help with research and referrals.</b><br><br>

There's a LOT of info out there—about cycles, testing, procedures, finances, and more.  

You can help lighten the load by taking on one or two topics—like:
- Finding fertility grants or insurance tips  
- Compiling questions for their provider  
- Researching doulas or support groups<br><br>

<b>6. Provide companionship during or after provider visits.</b><br><br>

Being there matters. You can:
- Take notes  
- Ask helpful questions  
- Offer comfort or decompress after appointments  
- Help plan next steps together<br><br>

<b>7. Respect their boundaries.</b><br><br>

Some may not want to attend baby showers. Others might avoid pregnancy announcements or talking about their TTC status.  

These boundaries can shift—so keep checking in gently, without pressure. Let them know they’re included and supported no matter what.<br><br>

<b>8. Help them celebrate the big and small moments.</b><br><br>

Even little wins deserve confetti.  

Did they get through a tough week? Schedule a test? Start a new treatment?  

Celebrate how they define progress, not just outcomes.<br><br>

<b>9. Know your limits—and when to suggest more support.</b><br><br>

Sometimes love means connecting them with others—like a therapist, doula, or TTC support group.  

These spaces can provide community, reduce isolation, and offer tools beyond what you alone can give.<br><br>

  content: `Pregnancy is possible any time sperm has a chance to meet up with an egg. That can happen if you’re having sex and not using birth control, including condoms, and sperm gets inside the vagina or onto the vulva, where it can then travel into the vagina. (Pregnancy can also happen if you’re using birth control, but it is much less likely.) Typically, pregnancy happens when someone with a penis ejaculates into the vagina or onto the vulva of another person. Ejaculation is when semen, a whitish fluid containing sperm, comes out of the penis.<br><br>

How likely you are to get pregnant from having sex without using birth control depends on where you are in your cycle when you have sex.<br><br>

<b>Why does it matter where you are in the menstrual cycle?</b><br><br>
To understand why it matters where you are in the menstrual cycle when you have sex without birth control, it helps to understand how the menstrual cycle works. Every new menstrual cycle starts with your period. Day one of your period is day one of that cycle. An average cycle, from the first day of your period to the day before your next period, is 28 days, but it can be longer or shorter and still be considered normal. You can only get pregnant from penis-in-vagina sex on six days during your menstrual cycle—the five days before you ovulate and the 24 hours after ovulation. These are your fertile days. If you have an average menstrual cycle, you usually ovulate in the middle of your cycle.<br><br>

The problem is that you can’t know for sure exactly when you’re ovulating, especially if you don’t have a regular menstrual cycle (more on that later). And sperm can live inside your body for up to 5 days, whether or not you’re on your period. That means if you ovulate today, you could get pregnant from sex you had up to 5 days ago. So if you’re going to have penis-in-vagina sex, no matter where you are in your cycle, your best bet for preventing pregnancy is to use some form of birth control, like the pill, condoms, an IUD, the pull-out method, emergency contraception (EC), or any one (or more!) of your many other choices.<br><br>

<b>What is a regular menstrual cycle?</b><br><br>
A regular menstrual cycle is one that comes at about the same time each month. It’s normal for most people with a uterus to have cycles lasting between 21 and 35 days, but having a regular menstrual cycle means that your cycle is between 26 and 32 days long. If your menstrual cycle is regular, your cycles are close to the same length every month, and ovulation happens on approximately the same day every cycle. If you have a regular, 28-day cycle, ovulation is most likely happening in the middle of your cycle, between days 12 and 16.<br><br>

<b>Here’s how to figure out long your menstrual cycle is:</b><br><br>
Step 1: Start by counting the first day that your period begins as day one.<br>
Step 2: Count each day after that until you get your period again, which is day one of the next cycle. So the first day of your period until the last day before your next period is one menstrual cycle.<br>
Step 3: Start over with day one to count the next cycle. That’s it!<br><br>

If you count the number of days in each cycle for a few cycles, and all your periods are between 26 and 32 days, then you have a regular period. Not every cycle has to be the exact same number of days—it’s normal for it to be a few days longer or shorter from month to month.  As long as it’s between 26 and 32 days long, your cycle is considered regular.<br><br>

Your menstrual cycle is considered irregular if it is less than 26 days or more than 32 days long more than twice a year, but if it’s between 21 days and 35 days, it could still be normal; it’s just not regular. If two or more months go by and you don’t have a period, that’s also considered an irregular menstrual cycle (or it may be a sign that you are pregnant).<br><br>

<b>How do I know when I’m ovulating?</b><br><br>
If you’ve counted the length of a few cycles, and your cycle is regular, there are a few different ways that you can estimate when you’re ovulating. You can track what day of your menstrual cycle you’re on, check your cervical mucus, track your body temperature, and/or monitor your hormone levels. Your best bet for preventing pregnancy by monitoring your ovulation is to use more than one of these ways to estimate when you’re ovulating.<br><br>

Tracking your menstrual cycles and paying close attention to your signs of fertility to predict ovulation and then avoiding sex without using another form of birth control (like condoms or a diaphragm) on those days is a type of birth control called fertility awareness. It can be effective at preventing pregnancy, but it’s not the most effective birth control option out there. Typically, about one in four people using this method will get pregnant within a year of using it.<br><br>

If your cycle is irregular though, it will be hard to predict when you are ovulating, and mistakes are likely to happen—meaning that at some point, it’s likely you will think you’re not ovulating when you are. Using a birth control method other than one of the fertility awareness methods, like condoms or the pill, is going to be a more effective way to prevent pregnancy.<br><br>

<b>Can I get pregnant during my period?</b><br><br>
The short answer is YES! If your menstrual cycle is regular, you are much less likely to get pregnant while on your period than if your menstrual cycle is irregular—but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible even with a regular cycle.<br><br>

<b>How soon can you test for a pregnancy after sex?</b><br><br>
Pregnancy doesn’t start the moment you have unprotected sex. In fact, it doesn’t start until a fertilized egg implants in the lining of your uterus, which takes about a week. So it doesn’t work to take a pregnancy test the day after you had sex.<br><br>

Once implantation occurs, your body begins making a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Home pregnancy tests measure hCG in urine to determine if you’re pregnant. Clinics can measure hCG in urine or in a blood sample. It takes up to two weeks after having sex for there to be enough hCG to measure with any test.<br><br>

So you have to wait for about two weeks after having sex to get an accurate pregnancy test result.<br><br>

<b>It’s too early for a pregnancy test…but is it too late for EC?</b><br><br>
If you’ve had sex in the last five days and don’t want to be pregnant, you can use emergency contraception (EC) right now. EC prevents ovulation and thus prevents pregnancy before it starts (which means that EC is not the same thing as abortion pills). There are a two types of EC pills and two IUDs that work as EC. EC pills can be effective if you take them up to five days after sex, but they are more effective the sooner you take them. The IUDs that work as EC are equally effective no matter when in those five days you get one, but you’ll need to see a provider in person to do so. Tell them it’s for EC so they can get you scheduled asap.<br><br>

<b>What if I’m pregnant and don’t want to be?</b><br><br>
Abortion is when you end a pregnancy on purpose, either with the abortion pill or with an abortion procedure. If you want to get an abortion, check out AbortionFinder to find a provider.<br><br>

      You might remember that back in 2022 mpox (formerly called monkeypox) caused infections around the world, including in the U.S.; while not a new virus, it had typically been confined to limited regions until an unexplained global outbreak that year was brought under control through vaccination and behavior changes. In 2025 it's back, with two known subtypes: clade II (the cause of the 2022 U.S. outbreak) and clade I, which is now spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries (Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda) but has not reached the U.S. To catch mpox you must have direct contact with an infected person's lesions or with contaminated items (clothing, bedding, towels), close face-to-face respiratory exposure (such as kissing, cuddling, heavy breathing during sex), or—rarely—transmission in utero; once symptoms appear, usually 3–21 days after exposure, you remain contagious until all blisters heal, which can take several weeks, and although most infections are mild, the virus can occasionally mutate to be more transmissible or airborne. Initial flu-like signs (fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, body aches, chills, cough, sore throat, congestion) are typically followed 1–4 days later by a rash of bumps that progress to yellow-fluid blisters and then crust over, often appearing on the face, arms, legs (including palms and soles), and sometimes genitals; this rash can be itchy and painful, and while it heals in 2–4 weeks without treatment, complications or even death can occur. Although it's unclear whether mpox spreads via semen or vaginal fluids, the close physical contact of sex clearly transmits the virus, so condom use is advised for 8–12 weeks after infection and any contaminated surfaces or objects—including sex toys—should be disinfected immediately.
      </p>
      <p>Prevention relies on the existing mpox vaccine (though the duration of protection from 2022 doses is unknown), and if you've been exposed you can receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the vaccine within 3 days to 2 weeks to avert infection; if symptoms arise, seek testing through a health care provider, and while there is no mpox-specific treatment, some smallpox antivirals and immune therapies may be effective.

      Yes, you can still get pregnant. The heat or chlorine in a hot tub will not kill sperm or make it more difficult for sperm to swim inside the vagina. Anytime semen gets inside the vagina or on the vulva—whether you are in a pool, hot tub, or romantic, candle-lit bedroom—you can get pregnant!
<br><br>
The good news is that you can’t get pregnant just from being in the water with semen, so unless you’re actually having penis-in-vagina sex in the water, you don’t have to worry about pregnancy.

In the U.S., about three in four sexually active people under 30 who have a uterus are using some type of birth control. Many of them ask me, does using birth control now hurt my chances of getting pregnant in the future? Sigh of relief: it does not.<br><br>

All reversible birth control methods—the pill (prescription and OTC versions), patch, ring, shot, IUDs, and implant—will help prevent pregnancy while you’re using them, but none have long-lasting effects on your ability to get pregnant when you stop. That’s why people who use the pill but accidentally forget to take it on time can get pregnant that month.<br><br>

Let’s look, for example, at how long it takes for people to get pregnant when they quit the pill compared to when they quit non-hormonal fertility awareness methods (FAM, sometimes called natural family planning). A big study of over 2,000 people who quit the pill after using it for an average of seven years found that 21% were pregnant in one month and 79% were pregnant in a year. Those who stopped using FAM had very similar rates of pregnancy, with 20–25% pregnant in one month and 80% pregnant in a year. In other words, people who quit the pill get pregnant just as fast as other women, even if they’ve used the pill for years.<br><br>

<img src="https://www.bedsider.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBamdLIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5d5e668e03a3e4319a27a2a05409d6783ac8441f/Percent_of_young_women_pregnant_over_time_by_the_birth_control_they_quit.jpg" alt="Pregnancy rate graph by method" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:20px auto;"><br><br>

People who quit the patch, ring, or IUD get pregnant at similar rates. Contrary to popular myth, modern IUDs do not hurt your future fertility. For some people who stop using the implant or the shot (Depo-Provera), it can take a few extra months to start normal menstrual cycles again. There may be a delay of up to two months after stopping the implant and up to six months after stopping the shot, but this varies from person to person, and most people get pregnant soon after stopping these methods.<br><br>

Okay, so birth control doesn’t hurt your chances of having a baby in the future. But there is something that does: untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By the age of 25, one in two young people having sex will get an STI.<br><br>

One of the most common STIs is a bacterial infection called chlamydia. It’s transmitted by sexual contact, and can be prevented by using condoms. It’s easy to treat with antibiotics, but it’s sneaky: more than half of people who have it have no symptoms. The longer an STI like chlamydia or gonorrhea goes untreated in the uterus or fallopian tubes, the higher the chance that it will cause scarring in the tubes that connect the ovaries and uterus. That scarring makes it difficult for an egg to travel the right direction, and hurts your chances of getting pregnant in the future.<br><br>

If you had sex with a new partner and didn’t use a condom, you can still protect yourself by getting tested. Luckily, getting tested for chlamydia or gonorrhea is easy and painless: you just pee in a cup. Getting treated just means taking some pills for a week. If you test positive, there are a bunch of different ways you can tell a partner they should get tested. And for future reference, here are some tips for making sex safer.<br><br>
