<p><i>Spoiler alert: life can get a whole lot easier</i></p>
<br>
<p>
  We’ll tell it to you straight: we stan the 
  <a href="#">birth control pill</a> (sometimes called “the pill”). She really has been THAT girl for over 60 years now. 
  And for 20 of those years, the <a href="#">Free the Pill</a> campaign has been working to make the birth control pill over the counter (OTC).
  And…it finally happened! <a href="#">Opill</a>, a progestin-only birth control pill, is officially available 
  <a href="#">over the counter</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  This is a massive win, no doubt. But it’s also just the beginning of increasing birth control access for everyone. 
  We’re thinking bigger: more access to birth control for more people + even more birth control pill options OTC = true equal access.
</p>

<p>
  So to celebrate how far we’ve come and daydream about where we can go in the future, 
  we’re highlighting <b>20 ways</b> the over-the-counter birth control pill makes life easier, better, and more equitable.
</p>

<br>

<ol>
  <li> <b>1.</b> Imagine a world where the birth control pill is legit grab ‘n go—no more waiting in that long pharmacy line.</li><br>

  <li> <b>2.</b> You can add the pill to your shopping list and self-checkout like a pro. (Yapping with the cashier: optional)</li><br>

  <li> <b>3.</b> You can pick up some bodega or corner store snacks and restock the BC pill supply for you and your roomie.</li><br>

  <li> <b>4.</b> Our rural baddies can save a trip or two just to get their birth control. 
    With the OTC birth control pill, the days of driving miles for a doctor’s appointment just to get a prescription 
    and the extra drive to the pharmacy to pick it up are over.
  </li><br>

  <li>  <b>5.</b> Say goodbye to the mental gymnastics of appointment scheduling <i>just</i> to get your birth control pill refill.</li><br>

  <li> <b>6.</b> TFW you forget your birth control pills at home while travelling but remember you can bop into a grocery store, 
    pharmacy, or big box store to restock. Welcome, sweet relief. 😌
  </li><br>

  <li> <b>7.</b> Gen Alpha can hop off the struggle bus. 
    Whole generations will grow up seeing OTC birth control pills on store shelves as ordinary as condoms and lube.
  </li><br>

  <li> <b>8.</b> Birth control pills being over the counter allows more people to avoid interactions with our health care system, 
    which can be complicated, risky, or unsafe for certain communities. 
    Young people, BIPOC, fat folks, enby (aka nonbinary) and trans folks, and undocumented people who often face bias 
    will have easier access to birth control.
  </li><br>

  <li> <b>9.</b> If you’re on your parent’s insurance, OTC birth control pills mean more privacy. 
    No more having to explain the decisions you make for your body. 
    (And if you need help paying, there are <a href="#">programs</a> that can help with the cost of OTC birth control pills.)
  </li><br>

  <li> <b>10.</b> Birth control pills being OTC is another way we can throw fatphobia in the trash. 
    Fat folks deserve access to birth control, free of other people’s moral high ground or opinions of their body.
  </li><br>

  <li> <b>11.</b> You get to decide when, where, and how you get your birth control—not your provider, parents, or random politician.</li><br>

  <li> <b>12.</b> One less visit to the doctor’s office means more time for watching <i>Love Island</i>. (Just us? 👀)</li><br>

  <li> <b>13.</b> We want to live in a world where there are more options for birth control over the counter than there are 🍆 pills.</li><br>

  <li> <b>14.</b> Young people don’t have to hear they’re not “old enough” or “responsible enough” to take care of themselves.</li><br>

  <li> <b>15.</b> OTC birth control pills means less people in your business.</li><br>

  <li> <b>16.</b> You don’t need permission to make decisions about your body, your sexual health, or your life. <b>PERIOD.</b></li><br>

  <li> <b>17.</b> Life is hard enough. Birth control access doesn’t have to be, too.</li><br>

  <li><b>18.</b> Not needing to see a health provider when you simply just want a birth control pill to manage your periods or acne.</li><br>

  <li><b>19.</b> Options = freedom. With more birth control OTC, you’re even more in control of your own body.</li><br>

  <li><b>20.</b> We’re thrilled that Opill is now on store shelves. And it’s just the beginning. 
    Let’s keep fighting for a future where everyone has access to birth control—free of judgement.
  </li><br>

<b>Meg started it all by bringing us hot girl summer 🔥</b><br/><br/>
<b>Charli gifted us brat summer 🍏</b><br/><br/>
<b>And now Lorde is blessing us with IUD summer 🙏🏾</b><br/><br/>

Many fans have been waiting patiently for Lorde’s upcoming album, <i>Virgin</i>. And with the recent album art drop, we noticed one of our fave birth control methods—the IUD—makes an appearance. (But if we’re being so for real, all the birth control methods are our fave and there’s no “best” method.)<br/><br/>

If Lorde’s album has you curious about the IUD, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a little IUD 101 to get you ready for that summer heat. 😉<br/><br/>

<b>What is the IUD?</b><br/>
The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, flexible T-shaped birth control method made of medical-grade plastic that goes inside your uterus. The IUD mainly prevents pregnancy by making it harder for sperm to move, preventing those swimmers from reaching an egg and fertilizing it. Some IUDs also affect ovulation (releasing the egg), so there’s no egg available to be fertilized. In both cases, no fertilization = no pregnancy.<br/><br/>

<b>So wait, there’s more than one IUD?</b><br/>
Yup! You’ve got choices, babe. There are currently 5 IUDs you can get in the U.S.: <b>Kyleena, LILETTA, Mirena, Paragard, and Skyla</b>.<br/><br/>
These 5 can be divided into two groups—<b>IUDs with hormones and without</b>. Kyleena, LILETTA, Mirena, and Skyla release a small amount of the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. The Paragard IUD is hormone-free and uses a small amount of natural, safe copper to prevent pregnancy. Just keep in mind that none of the IUDs protect against STIs, so use condoms or internal condoms for that.<br/><br/>

<b>How well do IUDs work at preventing pregnancy, really?</b><br/>
The IUD works very well—it’s one of the most effective birth control methods out there. It’s over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy and super safe to use. In other words, if 100 people use an IUD, less than 1 will get pregnant in a year. The perk? It’s super easy. No daily pills, no pre-sex prep. Just round-the-clock protection.<br/><br/>

<b>How long does the IUD last?</b><br/>
IUDs can offer years of protection from pregnancy. Here’s the breakdown:<br/>
• <b>Paragard:</b> up to 12 years<br/>
• <b>Mirena:</b> up to 8 years<br/>
• <b>Kyleena:</b> up to 5 years<br/>
• <b>LILETTA:</b> up to 8 years<br/>
• <b>Skyla:</b> up to 3 years<br/><br/>
But you don’t have to commit for the full time—you can get it removed anytime you like.<br/><br/>

<b>It can’t all be cupcakes and rainbows. What kind of side effects can I expect with the IUD?</b><br/>
Cramping and spotting are pretty common in the first few months, but tend to get better. Hormonal IUDs can actually reduce painful periods and PMS. Some people stop getting periods altogether.<br/><br/>
The non-hormonal Paragard may cause heavier or longer periods at first. But that usually improves. Over-the-counter pain relievers like Aleve or Advil can help.<br/><br/>

<b>But that insertion though…</b><br/>
We won’t lie—it can be painful for some. The procedure takes just 5–10 minutes but can feel like intense cramps. Everyone’s pain tolerance is different. The good news? More awareness and stories shared online are helping doctors manage pain better than before. You deserve compassionate care—speak up for what you need.<br/><br/>

<b>What if I get the IUD and don’t like it?</b><br/>
No worries! You can get it removed anytime by a healthcare provider. Many side effects ease over time, but if it’s not working for you, it’s your choice. Removal is usually quick and only mildly crampy.<br/><br/>
After removal, your periods and fertility typically return to normal. Just make sure you switch to another birth control method if you’re not trying to get pregnant.<br/><br/>

<b>Not into IUD summer?</b><br/>
That’s cool too. There are tons of other birth control options. Check out our method explorer to find the best fit for you—just in time for summer ☀️

<b>Opill, the new, long-awaited over-the-counter birth control pill, has hit the shelves!</b><br/><br/>
Here’s everything you need to know about it, including why you might want to choose it, how it works, where and how you can get it, and how to start taking it.<br/><br/>

<b>What is Opill?</b><br/>
Opill is a new progestin-only birth control pill (also called the mini-pill), that is available over the counter. That means you don’t need a prescription to get it. Opill is now available on Amazon, Opill’s website, and some drugstores, convenience stores, and grocery stores.<br/><br/>

<b>What is the difference between Opill and the mini-pill (the progestin-only birth control pill)?</b><br/>
Opill contains the same type of hormone and works the same way as other progestin-only birth control pills. The only difference between the over-the-counter birth control and prescription birth control is how you get it. Like all other versions of the mini-pill, Opill is estrogen-free and contains a single hormone, progestin. The main way progestin prevents pregnancy is by thickening cervical mucus, which makes it harder for sperm and egg to meet. To be effective at preventing pregnancy, Opill (like most mini-pills) should be taken as close as possible to the same time every day.<br/><br/>

<b>What is the difference between Opill and the combination birth control pill?</b><br/>
There are many different brands of birth control pills, but only two main categories of pill—the mini-pill (progestin-only pill) and the combination birth control pill. Both types of birth control pills contain hormones. The biggest difference between them is how you use them and which hormones they contain. The mini-pill only contains progestin. Combination birth control pills contain both estrogen and progestin. Opill is a brand of mini-pill.<br/><br/>
If you use the progestin-only pill, or mini-pill, you have to be much more careful to take your pill at the same time every day. If you are more than 3 hours late taking the mini-pill (unless you’re using the brand Slynd, which offers more flexibility), you will need to use a backup method of birth control for the next 48 hours. With the combination pill, you just need to make sure to take a pill a day—the timing doesn’t matter.<br/><br/>

<b>Why would someone choose Opill over another type of birth control pill?</b><br/>
There are many reasons why someone might choose Opill––some have to do with the fact that Opill is a type of mini-pill, and some have to do with the fact that it’s available over the counter. The mini-pill is often prescribed if you’re sensitive to combination pills and having side effects or can’t take estrogen for some other reason.<br/><br/>
Because Opill is available over the counter, unlike all of the other birth control pills, which require a prescription, you don’t need to talk to a health care provider to start taking it. That means it might be easier to get, more private, and maybe even less expensive than using other types of birth control pills.<br/><br/>

<b>Is Opill the same as emergency contraception (EC)? Is it the same as the abortion pill?</b><br/>
Nope. Opill is a birth control pill, meaning that you take it consistently to prevent pregnancy. EC allows you to prevent pregnancy AFTER having unprotected sex. The abortion pill ends a pregnancy that has already started.<br/><br/>

<b>How do I switch from another birth control method to Opill?</b><br/>
You can start taking Opill at any time in your cycle. You may or may not need to use a backup form of birth control, like condoms, when you switch to Opill––it depends on what kind of birth control you’ve been using (if any) and how consistently you’ve been using it.<br/><br/>
If you are switching to Opill from a non-hormonal method of birth control, if you’re on a hormonal method but haven’t been using it consistently (you’ve missed pills or forgotten to change your ring or patch), or if you haven’t been using any type of birth control, you will need to use a backup method of birth control for 48 hours after starting Opill.<br/><br/>
If you have been consistently using another method of hormonal birth control, including other brands of birth control pills, and you want to switch to Opill, you can start taking Opill the day you get it and stop using your old method right then, and you’ll be protected from pregnancy. You don’t need to use a backup method of birth control after starting on Opill. For example, if you’re using another brand of birth control pill, you can take your last pill from that pack one day and then the first pill from the new pack of Opill the next day. If you’re switching from a combination pill to Opill, make sure you switch during the time you are using the active pills. If you switch while you’re using the inactive pills at the end of the pack, you’ll need to use a backup method for 48 hours after starting Opill.<br/><br/>

<b>How quickly does Opill start to protect against pregnancy?</b><br/>
If you’re not on a hormonal method of birth control, or if you’re on a hormonal method, but you haven’t been using it consistently, when you start taking Opill, it will start being effective at preventing pregnancy after 48 hours. If you have sex during those first 48 hours, you’ll need to use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control to prevent pregnancy.<br/><br/>

<b>How do I take Opill?</b><br/>
You simply take one pill a day around the same time. To be effective at preventing pregnancy, Opill needs to be taken every day within a three-hour window. For example, you could take Opill daily between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm, though it will be easier not to accidentally go outside the three-hour window if you plan to take it at the same time every day. Some people set an alarm or take their pill at the same time that they do something else every day.<br/><br/>
If you take your pill at any time during that three-hour window, you’re good to go! Opill is 98% effective at preventing pregnancy when taken at the same time daily.<br/><br/>

<b>What happens if I miss a pill or I’m late taking it?</b><br/>
Anytime you are more than three hours late taking Opill, you will need to use a backup method, like condoms, for the next 48 hours.<br/><br/>
If you miss taking Opill during that three-hour window (which will mean that it’s been more than 27 hours since your last pill), take the missed pill as soon as you remember and then go back to your normal time the next day. Even if it means taking two pills in one day, that’s okay. Use a backup method for 48 hours while continuing to take Opill every day.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I start Opill right after using emergency contraception pills?</b><br/>
EC pills are birth control you take after sex to prevent pregnancy before it starts. Over-the-counter EC pills, like Plan B, also contain progestin, the same hormone in Opill. You can start Opill right after using EC (although you may want to wait until the next day to reduce nausea), but you’ll need to use a backup method to prevent pregnancy for 48 hours after starting Opill. If you use prescription EC pills (which have the brand name ella), you’ll need to wait 5 days after taking EC to start Opill to avoid making your EC pill less effective.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I start Opill right after having an abortion?</b><br/>
It depends on what type of abortion you have. If you have an abortion procedure, it’s totally safe (and often convenient!) to start birth control on the same day as your abortion. That means you can start using Opill (or another brand of pill) that same day.<br/><br/>
If you have a medication abortion (sometimes called “the abortion pill”), you’ll be able to start Opill or another hormonal method of birth control immediately after your abortion is complete (that is, as soon as you’ve finished the heavier bleeding that starts after the last pills).<br/><br/>

<b>Can I start Opill right after giving birth?</b><br/>
Yes! All brands of the mini-pill are safe to use immediately after giving birth, including if you’re breastfeeding.<br/><br/>

<b>Is there anyone who shouldn’t use Opill?</b><br/>
Opill is safe for almost everyone who can get pregnant. You shouldn’t use Opill or any other brand of mini-pill if you currently have breast cancer. Talk to a health care provider before using the mini-pill if you have a history of cancer, have vaginal bleeding and don’t know why, have liver disease or a liver tumor, have a history of stroke, have had bariatric surgery, or have lupus or heart disease. Also talk to your provider about whether the mini-pill is safe for you if you are taking anticonvulsant medications, like seizure medications.<br/><br/>

<b>What are the possible side effects of Opill?</b><br/>
Opill, like other brands of the mini-pill, may have side effects for some people. They may include headaches, bleeding changes, sore breasts, nausea, acne, and a change in your sex drive.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I still talk to my doctor about birth control if I’m using Opill?</b><br/>
Absolutely. Health care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists, can be great resources to talk to about your birth control and other sexual health needs, even when you’re using birth control you get without a prescription, like Opill or condoms. And if you have questions about Opill, they should be able to answer those too.<br/><br/>

<b>Where can I get Opill and how much is it?</b><br/>
Opill is now available on Amazon, Opill’s website, and some drugstores, convenience stores, and grocery stores. There is a suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply and $49.99 for a three-month supply in stores. Each retailer or store can set their own price, so it may be different based on where you’re getting it and/or where you live. A six-month supply is also available for $89.99 at Opill.com.<br/><br/>

<b>Do I have to talk to a pharmacist when I’m buying Opill or can I check out at any register?</b><br/>
Opill is approved by the FDA for over-the-counter use for people of all ages and gender identities without a prescription and without having to talk to a pharmacist or other health care provider. There are no limits on who can buy Opill, and no one should ask for your ID to buy it. However, individual stores and retailers may choose to lock up Opill, meaning you may have to talk to someone who works there to have it unlocked.<br/><br/>

<b>I can’t remember to take the pill every day. Is there another method I can use?</b><br/>
Taking a birth control pill every day works great for some people, but for others, it just isn’t a good fit. Check out our Method Explorer for all the information you need about methods of birth control you don’t have to use every day, from condoms you only use when you have sex, to the ring, which you only have to think about twice a month, to IUDs and implants that are effective for years.<br/><br/>

//   content: `<i>This article originally appeared on Bedsiderr Providers. While it was written by a provider for other providers, we thought it might be helpful for our Bedsiderr readers to see as well. We want you to know we’re committed to addressing health disparities, and part of our approach to that work is through provider education.</i><br><br>

// From the #metoo movement to reports of sexual assault being front and center on national television with the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, consent has been making the news headlines. Health care providers have an opportunity to provide a safe space to discuss enthusiastic consent in relationships and to model it in the exam room by obtaining explicit consent from our patients prior to performing intimate exams in the office. Consent is an important component of establishing a respectful and trusting relationship with your patient—one that improves satisfaction, adherence, and ultimately, outcomes.<br><br>

// Obtaining consent for an exam does not need to mean having a patient sign a lengthy consent form before a pelvic exam is performed. It does involve asking and waiting for verbal permission to touch. <b>Here are a few practical examples of how you can incorporate the language of explicit consent in the exam room:</b><br><br>

// <b>1. Greet your patients when they’re fully clothed</b><br>
// Sending the message that you care about consent and welcome patients as equal participants in their health care starts before you walk through the door. If your staff asks a patient to undress before you even meet them, you’re taking away their opportunity to consent to each step. You also create a power imbalance where the clothed provider meets a vulnerable, half-clothed patient.<br><br>

// <b>2. Ask before you touch instead of tell before you touch</b><br>
// Small changes like asking “Is it okay if I touch now?” instead of “Now you will feel my touch,” can make a huge difference in how safe and in control patients feel. You can also let patients defer the exam or remind them it can stop at any point.<br><br>

// <b>3. Check in during the exam</b><br>
// Elevating the exam table 30 degrees allows eye contact. During the exam, ask “How are you doing?” or “Tell me if you want to stop.” Let patients know, “I’ll stop anytime you ask.” And if they ask you to stop, do so—immediately.<br><br>

// <b>4. Offer a chaperone</b><br>
// Always offer a chaperone during intimate exams, regardless of your gender. Also, ask for permission before bringing in learners or assistants. Give patients the opportunity to decline privately—before the chaperone enters the room.<br><br>

// <b>5. Stop if your patient says “no”</b><br>
// If a patient refuses an exam, do not pressure them. Work around it, create an alternate care plan, and explore their concerns respectfully. Listening and validating their feelings builds trust—and avoids violating consent.<br><br>

// <b>6. Consent applies to birth control too</b><br>
// Respect your patient’s contraceptive decisions, even if they don’t align with your preference. Patients may prioritize factors other than effectiveness. With methods like IUDs or implants, always remind patients that they can have them removed at any time—for any reason.<br><br>

// <b>7. Always get consent for an exam under anesthesia</b><br>
// Before performing pelvic exams under anesthesia, get explicit consent. Explain the reason, who will be present, and whether students or residents will participate. Learners must meet the patient and receive consent <b>before</b> anesthesia is administered.<br><br>

// Respecting our patients by prioritizing communication and explicit consent in the exam room strengthens the patient-provider relationship and ultimately improves health. When patients feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to return for care—and more likely to speak up when something feels wrong.<br><br>

//   showSocialIcons: true,
//   content: `When you first consider telehealth, you might wonder: when do I actually need to go see a provider in person? Well, that’s a really good question!<br><br>

// Because, while telehealth is great for a lot of things, it’s not great for everything. It’s a perfect option for things like getting started on birth control or renewing a birth control prescription, getting tested and treated for STIs, and even getting treatment for UTIs and vaginal infections. But there are going to be times when you really do need to physically be in the doctor’s office in order to get the best health care possible.<br><br>

// <b>Here are five times you’ll need to get health care in person:</b><br><br>

// <b>1. To get an IUD, an implant, or the shot (or to remove an IUD or implant)</b><br>
// There are plenty of birth control options that you can start via telehealth, like the ring, the patch, and the pill. Others don’t require you to see a provider at all—think condoms, internal condoms, spermicide, fertility awareness methods, and withdrawal.<br><br>

// But to get an IUD, an implant, or the shot, you do need to see a provider in person. The same goes for removing an IUD or implant. There is a form of the shot called SubQ Depo that you can give yourself at home, but the standard shot (Depo-Provera) requires an in-person visit.<br><br>

// <b>2. To treat a recurring or difficult-to-treat infection</b><br>
// You can get tested and treated for many common infections through telehealth—STIs, UTIs, yeast infections, and BV among them. But if you’ve already been treated and symptoms persist or return, it’s time to go in person to ensure you’re getting the correct diagnosis and medication.<br><br>

// If this is your first time having symptoms, like a UTI or vaginal infection, it’s also better to get diagnosed in person.<br><br>

// <b>3. For most abortions</b><br>
// If you need an abortion, you’ll likely need to see a provider in person. Some services, like the TelAbortion study (in certain states) or Just The Pill (in Minnesota), offer medication abortion via telehealth—but these are limited.<br><br>

// For most people, in-person care is still necessary for abortion services.<br><br>

// <b>4. For your Pap smear</b><br>
// Pap smears test for abnormal cervical cells that could lead to cervical cancer. This can’t be done via telehealth. Some home HPV testing (like from Nurx) is available, but it’s not a full replacement for a Pap smear.<br><br>

// Most people should get a Pap every 3 years, but that may vary if you’ve had abnormal results. If you’re due for one and concerned about COVID-19, ask your provider if it’s safe to wait.<br><br>

// <b>5. To diagnose certain conditions, like PCOS or endometriosis, that require more extensive testing</b><br>
// Chronic conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or fibroids often require in-person testing—pelvic exams, blood work, ultrasounds, and sometimes surgery. Telehealth is great for managing these conditions, but diagnosing them usually starts in the exam room.<br><br>

// A good first step is a telehealth check-in. Your provider can let you know if in-person follow-up is needed.<br><br>

// <b>The bottom line:</b><br>
// Going to see a health care provider while never leaving your couch is awesome—but sometimes you still have to put on pants and go in person. And that’s okay. Telehealth and in-person care go together like condoms and lube.<br><br>
