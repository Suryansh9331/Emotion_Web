//   content: `You might remember back in 2022, when people around the world, including in the U.S., were diagnosed with infections from mpox, previously called monkeypox. Mpox is back in the news in 2024.<br/>Here’s what you need to know:<br/><br/>

// <b>What is mpox?</b><br/>
// Mpox is a virus that can spread from person to person and from animals to people.<br/>
// It’s not a new virus (like COVID was in 2019), but it has generally been diagnosed in limited areas of the world.<br/>
// Researchers are not sure yet what caused the virus to spread and create outbreaks around the globe in 2022 or what’s causing this new outbreak.<br/>
// However, they do know that vaccination and changes people made to decrease their risk of getting mpox helped to stop the spread.<br/><br/>

// <b>What’s new in 2024?</b><br/>
// There are two subtypes of mpox, called clade I mpox and clade II mpox.<br/>
// The mpox outbreak in 2022 that spread in the US was caused by clade II mpox.<br/>
// The current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and several neighboring countries in central Africa, including Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda, is caused by clade I mpox.<br/>
// So far, it hasn’t spread to the U.S. and the CDC doesn’t expect it to anytime soon.<br/><br/>

// <b>Could I get mpox?</b><br/>
// Right now, in 2024, clade I mpox is only known to be spreading in specific areas of the world.<br/>
// If you have recently visited or are in close contact with someone who has visited those areas in the last three weeks, it’s possible you could get mpox.<br/>
// There are a few main ways that we know of that mpox can pass from person to person.<br/>
// It’s also possible to get mpox from animals that are infected with the virus.<br/>
// The first way to get mpox is if someone touches the blisters of a person with mpox or touches surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with the mpox virus, such as clothing, bedding, or towels.<br/>
// It can also be passed through respiratory fluids from close face-to-face contact, like through heavy breathing during sex, or during kissing, cuddling, or close conversations.<br/>
// It’s also possible for a pregnant person to pass mpox through the placenta during pregnancy.<br/>
// Someone with mpox can pass the virus to other people from the time they first experience symptoms until the blisters are completely healed, which could take several weeks.<br/>
// It’s possible that the mpox virus that’s causing the current outbreak has mutated to be more transmissible or to be passed through the air without close physical contact, but we don’t know that for sure yet.<br/><br/>

// <b>How do I know if I have mpox?</b><br/>
// Symptoms from both subtypes of mpox are similar, but clade I mpox infections, which are responsible for the current outbreak, are more contagious and cause more serious infections than clade II mpox.<br/>
// They usually start between three days and three weeks after exposure to the virus.<br/>
// The most common symptoms are fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, body aches, and chills, as well as cough, sore throat, and congestion.<br/>
// The initial flu-like symptoms are usually followed one to four days later by a rash, although some people have developed a rash without having a fever or other symptoms first.<br/>
// The mpox rash is most likely to be on your face, arms, and legs, including the palms of your hands and soles of your feet, but it can be on other parts of your body, including your genitals.<br/>
// Over the course of five to seven days, the rash progresses from small bumps to larger blisters filled with yellow fluid before crusting over, drying out, and being replaced by new skin.<br/>
// The number and size of blisters can vary a lot from person to person, from one or just a few blisters to blisters covering the entire body.<br/>
// Unfortunately, the rash can be itchy and quite painful.<br/>
// While most mpox infections are mild and symptoms resolve on their own without treatment, it can take two to four weeks for the blisters to completely heal.<br/>
// In some cases, mpox can lead to complications and even death.<br/><br/>

// <b>Is mpox a sexually transmitted infection (STI)?</b><br/>
// It’s not yet known whether mpox is spread through semen, vaginal fluids, or blood.<br/>
// However, it is spread through close physical contact, which is often involved in sex.<br/>
// So mpox is definitely passing between sexual partners, but what isn’t clear is if it’s just from the close contact, or if semen or vaginal fluids are also contributing to passing mpox.<br/>
// It’s important to keep in mind that anyone who is exposed to the virus can get mpox, regardless of their age, what kind of sex they have, who they have sex with, or what their gender identity is.<br/><br/>

// <b>What can I do to prevent mpox?</b><br/>
// The good news is that we already have a vaccine available for mpox.<br/>
// But we don’t yet know if people who were vaccinated in 2022 are still protected in 2024.<br/>
// Until we know more about how mpox is passed (or not) during sex, the recommendation is to use condoms or internal condoms if you have sex with someone who has had mpox for eight to 12 weeks after the infection.<br/>
// We know that’s a big range, but scientists haven’t been able to narrow it down yet.<br/>
// Because mpox can be passed from contaminated surfaces and objects, including fabrics and sex toys, it’s also important to make sure you immediately disinfect any items and areas someone with mpox has used or touched.<br/><br/>

// <b>Can I do anything if I’ve been exposed to mpox?</b><br/>
// If you think you’ve been exposed to mpox, you can get an mpox post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, with the mpox vaccine within three days to two weeks of exposure to prevent infection.<br/>
// Contact a health care provider or your local health department to find out where you can get an mpox vaccine.<br/><br/>

// <b>What should I do if I think I have mpox?</b><br/>
// Contact a health care provider and ask if they can test you for mpox.<br/>
// There are tests for mpox and most health departments can now test for mpox, but you’ll need to see a health care provider to get tested.<br/>
// There are currently no treatments specifically for mpox, however treatments developed for smallpox, including anti-retroviral medications, and some immune therapies can be effective.<br/><br/>

// By Emma McGowan Feb 28, 2023<br/>
// Ah, chlamydia! It’s such a pretty-sounding name—like a type of orchid or maybe a Greek goddess—for a not-very-nice infection.<br/>
// Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI), with an estimated 2.86 million infections per year according to the CDC.<br/>
// It’s especially common in people under the age of 25, people with vaginas, and people with penises who have sex with other people with penises.<br/>
// But don’t freak out yet! The good news is that, unlike viral STIs like herpes and HPV, chlamydia is totally curable with either one dose or seven days of antibiotics.<br/>
// If you test positive for chlamydia, there are a few different ways that you can get treatment.<br/>
// Your health care provider may give you the medication in the office or they may prescribe you the medication for you to get from a pharmacy.<br/>
// Or your partner can get it for you when they get their own meds.<br/>
// If you get your medication from a partner (by the way, this is called “expedited partner therapy”), they should also give you information about the medication and what infection you are being treated for.<br/>
// If you take the medicine as directed (and your partner or partners also take their medication), you should be good to go (at it) again one week after both you and your partner(s) have finished your medication.<br/>
// It’s really important for preventing re-infection to not have sex at all from the first day of treatment until seven days after the last person finishes taking their medication.<br/>
// The CDC recommends retesting for chlamydia three months after being treated for it.<br/>
// Now that you know that it’s common and curable, let’s take a closer look at chlamydia—what it looks like, what it does, and how to avoid it.<br/><br/>

// <b>How do you get chlamydia?</b><br/>
// Chlamydia is spread via vaginal or anal sex (and, less frequently, oral sex) with a person who has chlamydia.<br/>
// It’s bacteria that likes to hang out in ejaculate (aka cum), pre-cum, and vaginal fluids.<br/>
// Important note: Because it’s found in pre-cum, you can get chlamydia from a person with a penis even if they don’t ejaculate.<br/>
// But you can’t get it from kissing, hugging, coughing, holding hands, or anything else that doesn’t involve genital fluid.<br/>
// Because chlamydia only lives in genital fluids, condoms are super effective as protection against it (and as protection in general!).<br/>
// So it’s always a good idea to wrap it up!<br/><br/>

// <b>What are the symptoms of chlamydia?</b><br/>
// Like so many other STIs, the most common symptom of chlamydia is…no symptom at all.<br/>
// That’s why it’s so important to get tested regularly.<br/>
// The CDC recommends that people with vaginas who are under the age of 25 get tested for chlamydia at least once per year—and more frequently if they have other risk factors, like having sex with a partner who had chlamydia or having sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.<br/>
// Those over 25 should get tested annually if they have more than one partner, a new partner, a partner who has other partners, or a partner who has tested positive for an STI.<br/>
// In fact, it’s a good idea in general to get tested for STIs once a year and anytime you’ve had sex with a new partner.<br/>
// Check out our clinic finder to look for a place to get tested in person or read up on how to get tested for STIs, including chlamydia, via telehealth.<br/>
// If people with vaginas do have symptoms, they can include abnormal vaginal discharge or a burning feeling when they pee.<br/>
// For people with penises, the most common symptoms are discharge from the penis and burning when they pee.<br/>
// And all people can get chlamydia in their butts.<br/>
// Just like with chlamydia in the vagina and penis, most people don’t have any anal symptoms.<br/>
// But if they do, they can include pain, discharge, and bleeding.<br/><br/>

// <b>How does chlamydia affect you in the long term?</b><br/>
// If chlamydia is treated, there are no long-term health effects.<br/>
// But if it goes undiagnosed or untreated—which is especially likely in people who don’t show symptoms—it can cause serious health problems in people with vaginas.<br/>
// Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) happens when an infection like chlamydia spreads from the vagina up into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.<br/>
// Symptoms can include pain in the lower abdomen, vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor, unusual bleeding, pain or bleeding during intercourse, pain when you pee, and fever.<br/>
// But it can also have no symptoms at all.<br/>
// If PID is left untreated for too long, it can lead to scarring and abscesses on the reproductive organs.<br/>
// In some cases, that can even lead to infertility and increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.<br/>
// It’s one more reason why getting tested for chlamydia regularly is an essential part of a healthy, sexually active life.<br/><br/>

//   updated: "Dec 10, 2024",
//   content: `Are you splashing around in the dating pool right now? Whether you’re looking for longer-term connections or exploring physical relationships with new sexual partners, there’s so much fun to be had.<br/>
// But with the excitement of the new and mysterious come the complexities of the new and mysterious.<br/>
// Discussing sexual health isn’t as taboo as it used to be, but some people may still feel awkward bringing it up or may worry that it’s a vibe killer.<br/>
// We get it–grown-up conversations are hard. But the issues that can come from not having this conversation are the ultimate vibe killer.<br/>
// These talks are essential and there are ways to approach them that won’t bring your sexy rapport to a screeching halt. Here’s what you need to know.<br/><br/>

// <b>Don’t mix the serious with the steamy</b><br/>
// We recommend avoiding having serious conversations during steamy situations.<br/>
// Even questions as simple as “do you have condoms?” are best asked before any clothes come off.<br/>
// When dopamine is high, so are emotions.<br/>
// Not only is your judgment clouded when you’re in the heat of the moment, but you’re also in a hyper-sensitive emotional state, so be sure to address these things before the situation gets too heated.<br/><br/>

// <b>Don’t assume it has to kill the vibe</b><br/>
// There are things that are good to know about a person before the situation turns sexual.<br/>
// Some things, like their desires and fantasies, can be a lot more fun to talk about than others, like STIs and trauma triggers.<br/>
// And while it’s best not to couple the serious chats with the heat of the moment, you can totally couple the fun conversations with the less fun ones.<br/>
// For example, consider saying something like, “I’m so attracted to you, and I can’t wait to take this to a physical level. Let’s get to know each other a bit better.”<br/>
// These conversations are (ideally) paving the way for a fun and safer sexual experience, so there’s no reason they can’t have a sexy vibe.<br/><br/>

// <b>De-stigmatize the subject matter</b><br/>
// Conversations about sexual health can be triggering or uncomfortable for some.<br/>
// Be sure to avoid adding any unnecessary embarrassment or shame when bringing up topics related to sexual health.<br/>
// One great way to do this is to just put it out there that it’s a bit awkward.<br/>
// That way, if the person you’re talking to is feeling uncomfortable, they’ll know they’re not alone.<br/>
// And maybe you can laugh about the awkwardness a little, which will help break the ice.<br/>
// You also don’t want to imply that if one of you has an STI, the whole thing has to come to a screeching halt.<br/>
// Using language like, “You don’t have an STI, do you?” can suggest that you think it’s a big problem if they do and could make them scared to be honest with you.<br/>
// Instead, consider mentioning that STIs are super common and that you recognize that there’s a lot of stigma around them, even if there shouldn’t be.<br/>
// You can also add that you’re coming from a completely neutral place and just hope to have a discussion.<br/><br/>

// <b>Offer info first</b><br/>
// Remember: you don’t want this to be an interrogation; you want it to be a conversation.<br/>
// Rather than springing questions on the other person, consider offering information first.<br/>
// Try something like, “I’ve been prioritizing my sexual health and just wanted to let you know that I’ve been tested recently.”<br/>
// This way, you’re showing that you share the responsibility with them, and you’re also letting them know it’s a safe space to be vulnerable.<br/><br/>

// <b>Put the “we” in sexual wellness</b><br/>
// It’s not you against them in these conversations. It’s the two of you together.<br/>
// We suggest coming at it with a “to keep things safe and fun for both of us, do you mind if we chat about sexual health?”<br/>
// You could also ask if they’d be comfortable going in to get tested together.<br/><br/>

// <b>Share (and be prepared to hold) your boundaries</b><br/>
// Suppose you have strict boundaries about condom use, exclusivity, transparency, or anything else.<br/>
// In that case, it’s up to you to express those as soon as it becomes evident that you might get physical with this person.<br/>
// Knowing your boundaries is incredibly empowering, but they can only be understood and respected if they are communicated.<br/>
// Sharing your boundaries early will also give you a chance to see if there are any sexual disconnects, which you’ll be happy you knew sooner than later.<br/>
// Keep in mind that expressing your boundaries doesn’t mean other people will necessarily respect them, and it’s up to you to enforce your boundaries if they don’t.<br/>
// For example, you may have a boundary about using condoms every time you have sex.<br/>
// That doesn’t mean the other person will necessarily agree to use condoms every time.<br/>
// What it means is that if they don’t, you can choose to enforce your boundary by not having sex with them or by sticking to types of sex that are safer to have when you’re not using a condom.<br/><br/>

// <b>Leave no room for nuance</b><br/>
// Last but not least, be direct.<br/>
// If you want to know if someone is living with an STI, you need to ask.<br/>
// “Have you been tested recently?” may get you some information, but it isn’t the same as asking if they have any STIs.<br/>
// If there is something you want to know, ask it explicitly.<br/>
// Advocating for your sexual health and sexual pleasure is an ongoing process that requires letting go of a lot of internalized stigma and taking the risk that things might be a little awkward sometimes.<br/>
// The key thing is to try to make your partner(s) feel comfortable and accepted, no matter what information they bring to the table.<br/>
// This type of conversation is rarely easy, but it’s worth it for your peace of mind and it will likely help you relax and enjoy the sex that much more.<br/><br/>

<b>How do I know if I have mpox?</b><br/>
Symptoms from both subtypes of mpox are similar, but clade I mpox infections, which are responsible for the current outbreak, are more contagious and cause more serious infections than clade II mpox.<br/>
They usually start between three days and three weeks after exposure to the virus.<br/>
The most common symptoms are fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, body aches, and chills, as well as cough, sore throat, and congestion.<br/>
The initial flu-like symptoms are usually followed one to four days later by a rash, although some people have developed a rash without having a fever or other symptoms first.<br/>
The mpox rash is most likely to be on your face, arms, and legs, including the palms of your hands and soles of your feet, but it can be on other parts of your body, including your genitals.<br/>
Over the course of five to seven days, the rash progresses from small bumps to larger blisters filled with yellow fluid before crusting over, drying out, and being replaced by new skin.<br/>
The number and size of blisters can vary a lot from person to person, from one or just a few blisters to blisters covering the entire body.<br/>
Unfortunately, the rash can be itchy and quite painful.<br/>
While most mpox infections are mild and symptoms resolve on their own without treatment, it can take two to four weeks for the blisters to completely heal.<br/>
In some cases, mpox can lead to complications and even death.<br/><br/>

<b>Is mpox a sexually transmitted infection (STI)?</b><br/>
It’s not yet known whether mpox is spread through semen, vaginal fluids, or blood.<br/>
However, it is spread through close physical contact, which is often involved in sex.<br/>
So mpox is definitely passing between sexual partners, but what isn’t clear is if it’s just from the close contact, or if semen or vaginal fluids are also contributing to passing mpox.<br/>
It’s important to keep in mind that anyone who is exposed to the virus can get mpox, regardless of their age, what kind of sex they have, who they have sex with, or what their gender identity is.<br/><br/>

<b>What can I do to prevent mpox?</b><br/>
The good news is that we already have a vaccine available for mpox.<br/>
But we don’t yet know if people who were vaccinated in 2022 are still protected in 2024.<br/>
Until we know more about how mpox is passed (or not) during sex, the recommendation is to use condoms or internal condoms if you have sex with someone who has had mpox for eight to 12 weeks after the infection.<br/>
We know that’s a big range, but scientists haven’t been able to narrow it down yet.<br/>
Because mpox can be passed from contaminated surfaces and objects, including fabrics and sex toys, it’s also important to make sure you immediately disinfect any items and areas someone with mpox has used or touched.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I do anything if I’ve been exposed to mpox?</b><br/>
If you think you’ve been exposed to mpox, you can get an mpox post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, with the mpox vaccine within three days to two weeks of exposure to prevent infection.<br/>
Contact a health care provider or your local health department to find out where you can get an mpox vaccine.<br/><br/>

<b>What should I do if I think I have mpox?</b><br/>
Contact a health care provider and ask if they can test you for mpox.<br/>
There are tests for mpox and most health departments can now test for mpox, but you’ll need to see a health care provider to get tested.<br/>
There are currently no treatments specifically for mpox, however treatments developed for smallpox, including anti-retroviral medications, and some immune therapies can be effective.<br/><br/>

    content: `Ah, chlamydia! It’s such a pretty-sounding name—like a type of orchid or maybe a Greek goddess—for a not-very-nice infection. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI), with an estimated 2.86 million infections per year according to the CDC. It’s especially common in people under the age of 25, people with vaginas, and people with penises who have sex with other people with penises.<br/><br/>

But don’t freak out yet! The good news is that, unlike viral STIs like herpes and HPV, chlamydia is totally curable with either one dose or seven days of antibiotics. If you test positive for chlamydia, there are a few different ways that you can get treatment. Your health care provider may give you the medication in the office or they may prescribe you the medication for you to get from a pharmacy. Or your partner can get it for you when they get their own meds. If you get your medication from a partner (by the way, this is called “expedited partner therapy”), they should also give you information about the medication and what infection you are being treated for.<br/><br/>

If you take the medicine as directed (and your partner or partners also take their medication), you should be good to go (at it) again one week after both you and your partner(s) have finished your medication. It’s really important for preventing re-infection to not have sex at all from the first day of treatment until seven days after the last person finishes taking their medication. The CDC recommends retesting for chlamydia three months after being treated for it.<br/><br/>

<b>How do you get chlamydia?</b><br/>
Chlamydia is spread via vaginal or anal sex (and, less frequently, oral sex) with a person who has chlamydia. It’s bacteria that likes to hang out in ejaculate (aka cum), pre-cum, and vaginal fluids. Important note: Because it’s found in pre-cum, you can get chlamydia from a person with a penis even if they don’t ejaculate. But you can’t get it from kissing, hugging, coughing, holding hands, or anything else that doesn’t involve genital fluid.<br/><br/>

Because chlamydia only lives in genital fluids, condoms are super effective as protection against it (and as protection in general!). So it’s always a good idea to wrap it up!<br/><br/>

<b>What are the symptoms of chlamydia?</b><br/>
Like so many other STIs, the most common symptom of chlamydia is… no symptom at all. That’s why it’s so important to get tested regularly. The CDC recommends that people with vaginas who are under the age of 25 get tested for chlamydia at least once per year—and more frequently if they have other risk factors, like having sex with a partner who had chlamydia or having sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.<br/><br/>

Those over 25 should get tested annually if they have more than one partner, a new partner, a partner who has other partners, or a partner who has tested positive for an STI. In fact, it’s a good idea in general to get tested for STIs once a year and anytime you’ve had sex with a new partner. Check out our clinic finder to look for a place to get tested in person or read up on how to get tested for STIs, including chlamydia, via telehealth.<br/><br/>

If people with vaginas do have symptoms, they can include abnormal vaginal discharge or a burning feeling when they pee. For people with penises, the most common symptoms are discharge from the penis and burning when they pee.<br/><br/>

And all people can get chlamydia in their butts. Just like with chlamydia in the vagina and penis, most people don’t have any anal symptoms. But if they do, they can include pain, discharge, and bleeding.<br/><br/>

<b>How does chlamydia affect you in the long term?</b><br/>
If chlamydia is treated, there are no long-term health effects. But if it goes undiagnosed or untreated—which is especially likely in people who don’t show symptoms—it can cause serious health problems in people with vaginas.<br/><br/>

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) happens when an infection like chlamydia spreads from the vagina up into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Symptoms can include pain in the lower abdomen, vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor, unusual bleeding, pain or bleeding during intercourse, pain when you pee, and fever. But it can also have no symptoms at all.<br/><br/>

If PID is left untreated for too long, it can lead to scarring and abscesses on the reproductive organs. In some cases, that can even lead to infertility and increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. It’s one more reason why getting tested for chlamydia regularly is an essential part of a healthy, sexually active life.<br/><br/>

Are you splashing around in the dating pool right now? Whether you’re looking for longer-term connections or exploring physical relationships with new sexual partners, there’s so much fun to be had. But with the excitement of the new and mysterious come the complexities of the new and mysterious.<br/><br/>

Discussing sexual health isn’t as taboo as it used to be, but some people may still feel awkward bringing it up or may worry that it’s a vibe killer. We get it–grown-up conversations are hard. But the issues that can come from not having this conversation are the ultimate vibe killer. These talks are essential and there are ways to approach them that won’t bring your sexy rapport to a screeching halt. Here’s what you need to know.<br/><br/>

<b>Don’t mix the serious with the steamy</b><br/>
We recommend avoiding having serious conversations during steamy situations. Even questions as simple as “do you have condoms?” are best asked before any clothes come off.<br/><br/>

When dopamine is high, so are emotions. Not only is your judgment clouded when you’re in the heat of the moment, but you’re also in a hyper-sensitive emotional state, so be sure to address these things before the situation gets too heated.<br/><br/>

<b>Don’t assume it has to kill the vibe</b><br/>
There are things that are good to know about a person before the situation turns sexual. Some things, like their desires and fantasies, can be a lot more fun to talk about than others, like STIs and trauma triggers. And while it’s best not to couple the serious chats with the heat of the moment, you can totally couple the fun conversations with the less fun ones.<br/><br/>

For example, consider saying something like, “I’m so attracted to you, and I can’t wait to take this to a physical level. Let’s get to know each other a bit better.” Something like this can replace the more serious and scary-sounding “before things go any further, there are some things we need to discuss.” These conversations are (ideally) paving the way for a fun and safer sexual experience, so there’s no reason they can’t have a sexy vibe.<br/><br/>

<b>De-stigmatize the subject matter</b><br/>
Conversations about sexual health can be triggering or uncomfortable for some. Be sure to avoid adding any unnecessary embarrassment or shame when bringing up topics related to sexual health. One great way to do this is to just put it out there that it’s a bit awkward. That way, if the person you’re talking to is feeling uncomfortable, they’ll know they’re not alone. And maybe you can laugh about the awkwardness a little, which will help break the ice.<br/><br/>

You also don’t want to imply that if one of you has an STI, the whole thing has to come to a screeching halt. Using language like, “You don’t have an STI, do you?” can suggest that you think it’s a big problem if they do and could make them scared to be honest with you. Instead, consider mentioning that STIs are super common and that you recognize that there’s a lot of stigma around them, even if there shouldn’t be. You can also add that you’re coming from a completely neutral place and just hope to have a discussion.<br/><br/>

<b>Offer info first</b><br/>
Remember: you don’t want this to be an interrogation; you want it to be a conversation. Rather than springing questions on the other person, consider offering information first. Try something like, “I’ve been prioritizing my sexual health and just wanted to let you know that I’ve been tested recently.” This way, you’re showing that you share the responsibility with them, and you’re also letting them know it’s a safe space to be vulnerable.<br/><br/>

<b>Put the “we” in sexual wellness</b><br/>
It’s not you against them in these conversations. It’s the two of you together. We suggest coming at it with a “to keep things safe and fun for both of us, do you mind if we chat about sexual health?” You could also ask if they’d be comfortable going in to get tested together.<br/><br/>

<b>Share (and be prepared to hold) your boundaries</b><br/>
Suppose you have strict boundaries about condom use, exclusivity, transparency, or anything else. In that case, it’s up to you to express those as soon as it becomes evident that you might get physical with this person. Knowing your boundaries is incredibly empowering, but they can only be understood and respected if they are communicated. Sharing your boundaries early will also give you a chance to see if there are any sexual disconnects, which you’ll be happy you knew sooner than later.<br/><br/>

Keep in mind that expressing your boundaries doesn’t mean other people will necessarily respect them, and it’s up to you to enforce your boundaries if they don’t. For example, you may have a boundary about using condoms every time you have sex. That doesn’t mean the other person will necessarily agree to use condoms every time. What it means is that if they don’t, you can choose to enforce your boundary by not having sex with them or by sticking to types of sex that are safer to have when you’re not using a condom.<br/><br/>

<b>Leave no room for nuance</b><br/>
Last but not least, be direct. If you want to know if someone is living with an STI, you need to ask. “Have you been tested recently?” may get you some information, but it isn’t the same as asking if they have any STIs. If there is something you want to know, ask it explicitly.<br/><br/>

Advocating for your sexual health and sexual pleasure is an ongoing process that requires letting go of a lot of internalized stigma and taking the risk that things might be a little awkward sometimes. The key thing is to try to make your partner(s) feel comfortable and accepted, no matter what information they bring to the table. This type of conversation is rarely easy, but it’s worth it for your peace of mind and it will likely help you relax and enjoy the sex that much more.<br/><br/>

For that reason, most people with an STI are unaware they have one.When STIs are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms, they’re still transmittable to others—and there’s no guarantee the STI will remain asymptomatic in the newly infected individual. Recognizable symptom or not, STIs can wreak havoc internally long before we’re aware of their effects; untreated asymptomatic STIs can pose long-term health risks like liver damage (eg.

// Of all the STIs, herpes might be the most misunderstood. From dire warnings and photos of serious infections in high school sex ed to jokes made on sitcoms to passing comments from friends, we’re constantly getting the message that getting herpes is the worst thing that could ever happen to a person. But that’s more about STI stigma than it is about the reality of living with herpes.<br/><br/>

// In reality, herpes is: 1. Much more common than most people realize. 2. Manageable (though not curable, because no viruses are curable). 3. Often symptomless or causing only minor symptoms.<br/><br/>

// So here are some common questions and the actual facts—without the scare tactics—about herpes.<br/><br/>

// <b>What is herpes and what is the difference between the types of herpes?</b><br/>
// Herpes is a virus that’s in the same family as shingles or chickenpox. (In fact, if an adult gets shingles, they’ll often be prescribed the same medication that’s prescribed for managing herpes!)<br/><br/>
// There are actually two types (called strains) of the herpes virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most herpes infections on and around the mouth, like cold sores, are caused by HSV-1. HSV-1 can also cause rare eye infections. Genital infections are typically caused by HSV-2, but you can get HSV-1 genitally and HSV-2 orally.<br/><br/>
// Both strains are treated the same way based on where the infection occurs, not which strain you have.<br/><br/>

// <b>What are the symptoms of herpes?</b><br/>
// Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause blisters or open sores (ulcers), as well as pain, itching, and burning. Symptoms may flare up multiple times in life. The first outbreak is usually the most severe and may include flu-like symptoms. HSV-2 infections are more likely to go undiagnosed and can be spread even without symptoms.<br/><br/>
// Many people never notice symptoms. The initial flare-up might resemble a pimple, ingrown hair, or minor cut. This is why so many people don’t know they have herpes.<br/><br/>

// <b>How do you get herpes?</b><br/>
// Herpes spreads via contact with a herpes sore, saliva (mouth infection), genital fluids, or skin-to-skin contact with an infected area. It needs to enter through a mucous membrane or break in the skin.<br/><br/>
// Condoms and dental dams reduce, but don’t eliminate, the risk. Herpes can be spread even when symptoms are not present.<br/><br/>

// <b>When should you be tested for herpes?</b><br/>
// Herpes testing isn’t standard unless you request it. Let your provider know if you’ve had exposure or symptoms. Visual diagnosis and swab testing are used if sores are present. A blood test can confirm exposure, but won’t indicate when or where it occurred.<br/><br/>
// Routine STI screening once a year and after new partners is a good habit, but providers typically don’t test for herpes without cause.<br/><br/>

// <b>How is herpes managed?</b><br/>
// There’s no cure for herpes, but it’s manageable. FDA-approved medications include acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. These can be used as:<br/>
// - <i>Episodic therapy</i>: taken during outbreaks<br/>
// - <i>Suppressive therapy</i>: taken daily to reduce flare-ups and transmission<br/><br/>
// Daily use can reduce outbreaks by 75% or eliminate them entirely, and lower the risk of transmission. Barrier methods like condoms and dental dams further reduce the risk.<br/><br/>

// <b>How not to freak out if you’re diagnosed with herpes</b><br/>
// It’s common to feel shame due to social stigma, but a diagnosis doesn’t change who you are.<br/><br/>

//   date: "By Talitha L. Bruney, MD",

//   content: `
// It seems like everybody’s talking about human papillomavirus (HPV) these days. From flyers in your health care provider’s office to ads in subway cars, information about HPV is everywhere. And that’s a good thing because HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) out there. In fact, the CDC reports that almost everyone who is sexually active will get HPV in their lifetime unless they are vaccinated.<br/><br/>

// So what exactly do you need to know if you find out you’re one of the many people who have been diagnosed with HPV? Here are some of the most common questions I hear in my practice as well as their answers:<br/><br/>

// <b>Is HPV serious?</b><br/>
// The answer is yes and no. There are more than 150 strains of HPV. Some are considered “high-risk” because they increase your risk of cancers (cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, throat). Others are “low-risk” and may cause warts—or no symptoms at all. High-risk HPV infections don’t show symptoms, so testing by a health care provider is the only way to detect them.<br/><br/>

// <b>Will I get cervical cancer if I have HPV?</b><br/>
// Testing positive for a high-risk strain means increased risk, but it does not mean you will get cancer. Most cervical cancers take years to develop. Frequent follow-up testing helps detect and treat pre-cancerous cells early. Testing positive means you’ll need more monitoring, but it won’t affect your fertility or cause pain, bleeding, or discharge.<br/><br/>

// <b>Should I get tested for HPV? What about my partner(s)?</b><br/>
// Only cervical HPV tests are routinely done. Anal Pap smears may be recommended for higher-risk individuals. If you test positive, your partners have likely been exposed. Partners with cervixes should be tested. Even if someone doesn't have a cervix, HPV can still lead to other cancers, and anyone infected can spread HPV.<br/><br/>

// <b>Is there treatment for HPV?</b><br/>
// There is no medication for high-risk HPV infections, but most cases clear up on their own—especially if you’re under 30. Smoking and certain medical conditions like HIV can prevent clearance. A healthy lifestyle won’t speed up clearance, but keeping appointments and quitting smoking can help.<br/><br/>
// <i>NOTE:</i> Genital warts caused by HPV can be treated with topical creams or removed in-office.<br/><br/>

// <b>Do I need to have a colposcopy?</b><br/>
// Depending on your test results, your provider might recommend a colposcopy. This procedure allows closer examination of the cervix using a microscope. It’s not a colonoscopy. Tissue samples (biopsies) may be taken to check for abnormal cells. Over-the-counter pain relief can help with cramping. Some bleeding or dark discharge afterward is normal.<br/><br/>
// Next steps depend on the results—normal findings may only require yearly follow-ups, while abnormal ones may need further procedures. The goal is early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.<br/><br/>

// <b>Can I find out how I got HPV?</b><br/>
// You may never know. HPV is very common, develops slowly, and testing is limited. This makes it hard to determine who transmitted it. Don't assume infidelity—both you and your partner may have had HPV exposure in the past.<br/><br/>

// <b>Can I prevent HPV infections?</b><br/>
// Yes—through the HPV vaccine. It’s most effective before becoming sexually active but still beneficial afterward. Even if you’ve had HPV or didn’t complete the vaccine series before, you can finish it now. The vaccine protects against other strains and is available for people up to age 45.<br/><br/>
// Barrier methods like condoms and dental dams reduce (but don’t eliminate) the risk.<br/><br/>

// <b>Final thoughts:</b><br/>
// HPV is extremely common and cervical cancer doesn’t appear overnight. Most HPV infections clear without complications. Staying on top of screenings and follow-ups is the best way to protect yourself.<br/><br/>

    content: `No. It’d be great if you could tell who had an STI (sexually transmitted infection, a.k.a. STD) and who didn’t, but the most common symptom of all STIs is no symptom at all. STIs are often asymptomatic or display such mild symptoms they go unnoticed and/or are mistaken for something else. For that reason, most people with an STI are unaware they have one.When STIs are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms, they’re still transmittable to others—and there’s no guarantee the STI will remain asymptomatic in the newly infected individual. Recognizable symptom or not, STIs can wreak havoc internally long before we’re aware of their effects; untreated asymptomatic STIs can pose long-term health risks like liver damage (eg. Hepatitis) and infertility (eg. Chlamydia and gonorrhea).

To protect yourself against STIs, use condoms or internal condoms.`,

An astounding 20 million people in the U.S. contract an STI every year, and those are only the STIs which get reported. That number is likely much higher due to under-reporting and many STIs not getting reported at all—some are diagnosed visually, and others are not documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of the 30-plus STIs out there, the CDC only reports on about 8 of them. Things like pubic lice, scabies, and HPV infections among guys are not part of those numbers.<br><br>

In so far as HPV is concerned, outside of the visual symptoms of genital warts caused by low-risk HPV strains, there’s no way to know if a man has it since he can’t be tested for it. This is one of the reasons why by the age of 50, at least 80% of women will have acquired the infection.

To protect yourself from STIs, use condoms or internal condoms, get tested regularly, and talk openly about sexual health with your partner(s).

      According to ASHA, “disease” suggests a medical problem associated with clear signs and symptoms. Since several of the most common sexually transmitted viruses have little to no signs or symptoms, it is more accurate to refer to them as infections rather than diseases. Also, the use of STI instead of STD reflects the reality that not all sexually transmitted infections turn into a disease.

 content: `Of all the STIs, herpes might be the most misunderstood. From dire warnings and photos of serious infections in high school sex ed to jokes made on sitcoms to passing comments from friends, we’re constantly getting the message that getting herpes is the worst thing that could ever happen to a person. But that’s more about STI stigma than it is about the reality of living with herpes.<br/><br/>

In reality, herpes is: 1. Much more common than most people realize. 2. Manageable, (though not curable, because no viruses are curable). 3. Often symptomless or causing only minor symptoms.<br/><br/>

So here are some common questions and the actual facts—without the scare tactics—about herpes.<br/><br/>

<b>What is herpes and what is the difference between the types of herpes?</b><br/>
Herpes is a virus that’s in the same family as shingles or chickenpox. (In fact, if an adult gets shingles, they’ll often be prescribed the same medication that’s prescribed for managing herpes!)<br/><br/>

There are actually two types (called strains) of the herpes virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2... It’s also possible to have both strains at the same time.<br/><br/>

“Both strains are treated by a provider in the same way based on where the infection is, not what strain of herpes you have,” says Watkins.<br/><br/>

“Something I’ve come to realize is that people who have HSV-1—which typically causes cold sores—they almost are like, ‘Well, I have HSV-1 so, it’s okay,’” says Emily DePasse... There is no “bad” or “good” herpes—just herpes.<br/><br/>

<b>What are the symptoms of herpes?</b><br/>
Both strains can cause blisters or open sores, called ulcers. They can also cause pain, itching, and burning. With both types of herpes, you can get flare-ups of symptoms multiple times over the course of your life. That’s because once you have it, the virus stays in your body for life, even when you don’t have symptoms.

According to Watkins, “The big difference between having HSV-1 and HSV-2 is the pattern of how often you get outbreaks and how likely you are to be able to pass the infection on to a partner when you don’t have an outbreak. For both HSV-1 and HSV-2, the first outbreak is usually the worst. Some patients may even have flu-like symptoms, like body aches. Overall, HSV-2 infections are more likely to be symptomless and go without being diagnosed. HSV-2 infections are also more likely to be spread even when you don’t have symptoms of an outbreak, like blisters.”

One thing people are often misinformed about is what herpes actually looks like. The images people find on Google and the ones they’re shown in high school sex ed are often very advanced cases of herpes in people having very strong reactions to the virus. Many people who have herpes either don’t have any symptoms at all or they’ve only had one flare-up and it was so small that they didn’t realize it was herpes. That initial flare-up can look like a pimple or an ingrown hair or even just a small cut. That’s why so many people who have herpes aren’t even aware they have it
<br> <br>
<b>How do you get herpes?</b><br/>
Herpes is spread through contact with: a herpes sore, the saliva of a person who has an herpes infection in their mouth (caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2), the genital fluids of a person with a herpes infection on their genitals (caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2), or the skin of a person who has herpes (this is called skin-to-skin contact).
<br>
Skin-to-skin contact doesn’t mean it can spread to any part of your body by touching any part of a person who is carrying the herpes virus. The herpes virus needs to come into contact with an opening, like a tiny cut or a mucous membrane (like the delicate skin inside your mouth), in order to get into your body. That’s why we see it so often near our mouths and our genitals—those are areas with mucous membranes.
<br>
Using condoms and dental dams can reduce the likelihood of spreading herpes, but it doesn’t totally eliminate the possibility. That’s because sores can happen in places that condoms and dental dams don’t cover and because even skin that doesn’t have a sore on it can spread the virus.
<br>
There are ways to reduce the likelihood of passing herpes to a partner, including by taking medication to prevent flare-ups (described below). Preventing flare-ups reduces the likelihood that you’ll transmit herpes. But it’s important to know that you can still pass herpes to a partner when you’re not having a flare-up and have no symptoms of herpes at all.
<br><br>
<b>When should you be tested for herpes?</b><br/>
Health care providers don’t routinely test for herpes, so it’s important to let them know if you have a partner who has been diagnosed with herpes or if you think you’ve been exposed. You should also be tested for herpes if you have any of the symptoms of herpes.
<br>
If you have sores, a provider may be able to diagnose herpes just by looking at them. They may also take samples from the sores and have them tested to see if they contain the herpes virus. There is also a blood test for herpes that can let you know if you’ve been exposed at any point in your life. But Watkins notes, “It can’t tell you when you were exposed or where on your body, so a positive result doesn’t mean you’ll have outbreaks or be able to pass the herpes virus to a partner.”
<br>
While it’s a good idea in general to get screened for STIs once a year, even if you don’t have any symptoms, and anytime you’ve had sex with a new partner, if you don’t have symptoms of a herpes infection your provider isn’t going to test for it. Check out our clinic finder to look for a place to get tested in person or read up on how to get tested for STIs via telehealth.
<br><br>
<b>How is herpes managed?</b><br/>
Herpes isn’t curable—no viruses are. But there are medications to manage it and steps people can take to reduce the risk of spreading it to a partner or partners.
<br>
There are three medications that are FDA-approved for managing herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. These medications can be used either as episodic therapy, meaning they’re taken at the first sign of a flare-up for a specified amount of time, or as suppressive therapy, meaning they’re taken daily in order to reduce the likelihood of a flare-up. Research has shown that taking the medication daily can reduce the number of flare-ups by at least 75 percent or even eliminate them all together. And suppressive therapy reduces the risk of passing herpes to others.
<br>
Additionally, people with herpes can use condoms and dental dams to further reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their partner or partners. And while using those barrier methods don’t eliminate the risk, it does greatly reduce it.
<br><br>
<b>How not to freak out if you’re diagnosed with herpes</b><br/>
When a person is diagnosed with herpes, it’s unfortunately really common for them to go into a shame spiral. That’s because many of us have been exposed to stigmatizing messages around herpes, and that we may have deeply absorbed those messages.
<br><br>
“You’re still you,” says Emily. “A lot of people lose their identity to what they think herpes means and they start to associate themselves with all of these societal negatives. You’re still you, before diagnosis and after diagnosis.”

And that’s a good thing because HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) out there. In fact, the CDC reports that almost everyone who is sexually active will get HPV in their lifetime unless they are vaccinated.<br><br>

So what exactly do you need to know if you find out you’re one of the many people who have been diagnosed with HPV? Here are some of the most common questions I hear in my practice as well as their answers:<br><br>

<b>Is HPV serious?</b><br>
The answer is yes and no. There are more than 150 strains of HPV. Some strains are commonly called “high-risk” because they increase your risk of certain types of cancers, including cancer of the cervix, vagina, and vulva; cancer of the penis; cancer of the anus; and cancer of the throat. Other strains are referred to as “low-risk” because they don’t increase your risk of cancer. However, some of these “low-risk” types of HPV can cause warts. (Though keep in mind that many low-risk strains cause no symptoms at all.) High-risk HPV infections don’t have symptoms, so the only way to know if you have HPV is to get tested by a health care provider.<br><br>

<b>Will I get cervical cancer if I have HPV?</b><br>
If you test positive for a high-risk HPV strain on your cervix, especially if you have several positive tests over a few years, you have an increased chance of developing cervical cancer. However, just being HPV positive does not mean that you will get cervical cancer. Most types of cervical cancer take years to go from pre-cancerous cells to cancer, so the key to preventing cervical cancer is to catch HPV infections and treat any pre-cancerous cells that show up on the cervix before they become cancerous.<br><br>

Testing positive for HPV on your cervix means you’ll need more frequent visits to your provider to monitor your cervix (usually with a Pap smear and/or an HPV test), but it does not affect your chances of getting pregnant, and it doesn’t cause pelvic pain, bleeding, or vaginal discharge.<br><br>

<b>Should I get tested for HPV? What about my partner(s)?</b><br>
Currently the only tests to check for HPV that are done routinely are tests that check for HPV on the cervix. Pap smears of the anus are also recommended for people who are at higher risk, like those who have receptive penetrative anal sex with people who have penises, and those with HIV infections.<br><br>

But if you test positive for an HPV infection, your sexual partner(s) have most likely been exposed to the virus as well. If your partner has a cervix, they should be tested for HPV as well. And while not having a cervix means you can’t get cervical cancer, HPV infections increase the chances of other types of cancer as well. Anyone who has the HPV virus can spread it to other people.<br><br>

<b>Is there treatment for HPV?</b><br>
There is no medication for high-risk types of HPV infections* but the good news is that HPV usually goes away on its own, especially if you are under 30. Smoking cigarettes and vaping as well as certain medical conditions like HIV can make it harder for your body to fight an HPV infection. When HPV hangs around longer, there’s a greater chance that it will cause pre-cancerous changes to your cells.<br><br>

While eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise are great for your overall health, they will not make HPV go away faster. That means that other than making sure you keep your appointments for follow up and do everything you can to break up with smoking, there isn’t much you need to do right now.<br><br>

*NOTE: If you have genital warts caused by HPV, your health care provider may recommend a prescription cream or gel you can use at home. There are also certain medications that can be applied to the warts in the office, as well as procedures to remove them.<br><br>

<b>Do I need to have a colposcopy?</b><br>
Based on the results of your HPV test and/or Pap smear, your provider may recommend you have a procedure called a colposcopy. A colposcopy uses a microscope to look at the tissues that make up the cervix more closely (FYI it has nothing to do with a colonoscopy). A colposcopy is the best way for your provider to tell how HPV is affecting your cervix.<br><br>

During a colposcopy you will be in the same position as you would be for a Pap smear, lying on the exam table on your back, with your feet in stirrups. Your provider may take small samples of tissue from your cervix. These tissue samples are called biopsies.<br><br>

Taking over-the-counter ibuprofen, like Motrin or Advil, before your procedure may help with cramping if they need to take biopsies. Your provider may also use a numbing medicine on your cervix before taking biopsies. It’s normal to have some bleeding and cramping after having biopsies is normal, including dark brown or black discharge.<br><br>

Based on the results of your colposcopy, you and your provider will discuss next steps. If the results are normal, you may only need another Pap smear and HPV test in a year, but if your biopsy results show pre-cancerous changes to your cervix, you may need an additional procedure and follow up to help prevent cervical cancer. Either way, to prevent cervical cancer, it’s important to stick with the follow up plan your provider recommends.<br><br>

<b>Can I find out how I got HPV?</b><br>
You may want to know who you got an HPV infection from, but the truth is that you may never know unless you have only ever had one sexual partner in your lifetime. Because HPV is a very common virus, infections develop slowly, and current testing options are limited to the cervix and anus, it’s difficult to determine who passed an HPV infection to you.<br><br>

You definitely don’t need to assume that your current partner has been unfaithful—you may both have both been exposed to HPV by different people at different points in your life.<br><br>

<b>Can I prevent HPV infections?</b><br>
Yes! You can prevent HPV by getting the HPV vaccine. Getting an HPV vaccine before you are sexually active is the best prevention since an HPV vaccine won’t protect you from an HPV strain you have already been exposed to. But even if you have already been diagnosed with HPV, getting an HPV vaccine now will protect you from other strains.<br><br>

And even if you started the vaccines a while ago and didn’t finish the series, you can complete the series now. Anyone up to age 45 who is at risk for HPV should talk to their provider about getting an HPV vaccine.<br><br>

Since HPV is passed from skin-to-skin contact, using condoms, internal condoms, and dental dams can decrease (but not eliminate) your chances of getting a high-risk HPV infection in the first place or passing an HPV infection to your partner.<br><br>

Overall, HPV is super common and cervical cancer doesn’t develop overnight, so don’t lose sleep tonight over testing positive for HPV. Most people who have an HPV infection find that their bodies get rid of it without it ever causing further problems, but keeping on top of your screenings and follow-ups can help you prevent cervical cancer.<br><br>
