            Babies are great... when you're ready for them. We think in the meantime you have the right to a healthy, 
            happy sex life without worrying about unplanned pregnancy. You can make that happen by taking an 
            active role in your reproductive health. We can help with that.

            . Power to Decide works to ensure that every young person has the power to decide if, when, 
            and under what circumstances to get pregnantâ€”increasing their opportunity to pursue the future they 
            want.

            Right now, seven in 10 pregnancies among unmarried women 18-29 are described by women themselves 
            as unplanned. That sounds like a lot to us. We hope that Bedsider will be a useful tool for women to learn 
            about their birth control options, better manage their birth control, and in the process avoid getting 
            pregnant until they're ready.
