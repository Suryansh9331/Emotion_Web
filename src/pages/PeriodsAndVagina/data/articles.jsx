  content: `<b>We shared nutrition hacks for better sex.</b> (Because bloated sex is rarely the best sex.) Now we’re exploring foods to eat that are beneficial for your vagina because we want you—and your downstairs—happy and healthy. <i>(Pro tip: these don’t go in your vagina.)</i><br><br>

<b>1. Water</b><br>
This should be no surprise, cause what can’t water do? Drinking enough water can help your body stay hydrated and can even help with vaginal lubrication.<br><br>

<b>2. Avocados, apples, and flaxseeds</b><br>
They are all super-healthy for many reasons, but for those who don’t like soy, remember that eating these three may also help you stay naturally lubricated down there.<br><br>

<b>3. Cranberry juice</b><br>
Loaded with acid compounds that fight off bad bacteria, drinking cranberry juice may help you prevent and relieve symptoms of urinary tract infections. Go for a natural, no-sugar-added brand to get the benefits. If symptoms don’t get better, it’s time to see a provider.<br><br>

<b>4. Probiotics</b><br>
They contain good bacteria your vag needs to maintain its healthy pH levels. Found in yogurt, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, sauerkraut, miso, and pickles with live cultures.<br><br>

<b>5. Garlic</b><br>
Known to be antimicrobial. Eating it raw may help fight yeast infections.<br><br>

<b>6. Eggs</b><br>
Packed with fatty acids, which help with blood flow and circulation.<br><br>

<b>7. Sweet potatoes</b><br>
Rich in vitamin A, they contribute to healthy vaginal and uterine walls and hormone production.<br><br>

<b>8. Soy</b><br>
Phytoestrogens in soy help keep your vagina lubricated. Stick with edamame, tofu, tempeh, and miso—not processed soy products.<br><br>

<b>9. Almonds and pumpkin seeds</b><br>
High in zinc, which helps regulate your menstrual cycle, hormones, and boosts your immune system.<br><br>

<b>10. Hot chilies</b><br>
Contain capsaicin which improves blood circulation and stimulates nerve endings—good for arousal.<br><br>

<b>11. Guava, kiwi, oranges, and green peppers</b><br>
Rich in vitamin C, which helps with stamina and can keep your sex drive active.<br><br>

<b>12. Dark chocolate</b><br>
The high-flavonoid kind is full of antioxidants and may enhance desire and sexual function. Chocolate also has magnesium (soothes nerves), methylxanthines (boosts libido), and phenylalanine (produces dopamine).<br><br>

<b>13. Fresh fruits and vegetables</b><br>
For fewer menstrual cramps, better skin, and easier orgasms, eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals. It benefits your whole body—from your pinky toes to your punani to your beautiful brain.<br><br>

If you add just a few of these to your eating routine, your vagina is gonna thank you. <b>Happy eating bbys!</b>`

<b>Birth control and your period</b><br>
<b>Will birth control change my period? Depending on your method, it might.</b><br>
<b>By Colleen Denny, MD and Robin Watkins, CNM, WHNP-BC</b><br>
<b>Date:</b> Feb 15, 2022<br><br>

It’s pretty common for hormonal birth control (pill, ring, patch, shot, implant, and hormonal IUD) and non-hormonal IUD to affect your period. Depending on your method, your period could:

<ul>
  <li>Get lighter or heavier</li>
  <li>Come more or less often</li>
  <li>Go away altogether</li>
</ul>

<b>Is it dangerous to have an irregular or missing period while on birth control?</b><br>
Nope! These changes are just side effects of the hormones or devices. They're safe, do not affect fertility, and don’t increase the risk of STIs.<br><br>

<b>Bonus:</b> Less bleeding can help with anemia, and many birth control types reduce the risk of certain cancers.<br><br>

<b>How exactly will my birth control change my periods?</b><br><br>

<b>1. The pill, the ring, and the patch</b><br>
<b>During the first few months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Light period during placebo pills/off week</li>
  <li>Spotting between periods is common</li>
</ul>

<b>After the first 3 months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Light, predictable period during off time</li>
</ul>

<b>Pro Tip:</b> If you use these methods continuously, your period might stop completely or just show as light spotting — both are safe.<br><br>

<b>2. Hormonal IUDs or the implant</b><br>
<b>During the first few months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Light, irregular spotting or prolonged bleeding</li>
</ul>

<b>After the first 3 months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Bleeding gets lighter</li>
  <li>Period may stop entirely</li>
  <li>Half of people with Mirena/Liletta IUDs report no periods after 3+ years</li>
</ul><br>

<b>3. The shot (Depo-Provera)</b><br>
<b>During the first few months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Light, unpredictable spotting</li>
</ul>

<b>After the first 3 months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Bleeding may stay light or stop entirely</li>
  <li>50% of users report no bleeding after 6–12 months</li>
</ul><br>

<b>4. Copper IUD (non-hormonal)</b><br>
<b>During the first few months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Heavier bleeding and more cramping in 70–80% of people</li>
  <li>Cycle timing remains regular</li>
</ul>

<b>After the first 3 months:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>80% of users report return to normal or lighter bleeding by 6 months</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Note:</b> Birth control used only at the time of sex (e.g. condoms, spermicide, pull-out) shouldn’t affect your periods.<br><br>

<b>What if I don’t like my bleeding pattern?</b><br>
Even though these changes are safe, they can be inconvenient. Here’s what you can do:<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Wait it out:</b> Most people adjust after a few months.</li>
  <li><b>Talk to your provider:</b> A different brand or medication may help.</li>
  <li><b>Switch methods:</b> If it’s not working for you, explore other birth control options.</li>
</ul><br>

      One of the main ways hormonal birth control prevents pregnancy is by stopping ovulation—meaning that the egg never leaves the ovary. The pill, the patch, the ring, and the shot are the methods that are the most reliable at blocking ovulation, so people using these methods may have fewer ovarian cysts. If you tend to get ovarian cysts, your provider may recommend one of these methods to prevent future cysts. The progestin-only pill, also called the mini-pill, has an unpredictable effect on ovulation and may actually lead to more cysts. These cysts almost always disappear on their own, but if you’ve had problems with cysts in the past, the mini-pill may not be the best birth control for you.

    content: `A cyst is basically a bubble—a collection of fluid with a thin wall around it. Functional cysts are formed when a follicle (the fluid-filled sac that develops around an egg during ovulation) grows larger than expected. Sometimes they can cause un-fun symptoms like abdominal discomfort, pelvic pain, pain during bowel movements, or pain during sex. Most cysts disappear on their own, but if they keep growing they can cause severe pelvic pain or pain that causes dizziness or fainting and comes with a fever or vomiting. If you have any of these severe symptoms, go see your health care provider ASAP. Some hormonal birth control methods—the ones that work by blocking ovulation—may mean fewer ovarian cysts. If you tend to get cysts, your provider might recommend you try a method like the pill, the ring, the patch, or the shot.

<b>TW: discussion of weight and BMI</b><br><br>

When I was 15, I was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It had taken about a year of doctor’s visits and testing to be officially diagnosed.<br><br>

It had been two years since my last period, and my pediatrician was concerned about my “overweight” BMI (I now know BMI is a flawed measurement and my weight was just fine).<br><br>

I was tested for thyroid disease and diabetes, but my results were normal. It wasn’t until I saw an endocrinologist who tested my hormone levels—sure enough, my testosterone levels were elevated, and I was diagnosed with PCOS. I guess that also explained the major peach fuzz on my upper lip.<br><br>

<b>PCOS</b> is a hormonal disorder that can cause:
<ul>
  <li>Ovarian cysts</li>
  <li>Excess hair growth</li>
  <li>Irregular periods</li>
  <li>Infertility</li>
  <li>Metabolic dysfunction</li>
</ul>

I’ve lived with this incurable disorder for over a decade, facing a variety of symptoms. Though I would never choose PCOS, it made me a better advocate—for myself and others.<br><br>

While I was lucky to be diagnosed early, I didn’t have an easy time managing symptoms. My periods came with intense cramping, bloating, and more. In high school, I would shove books into my stomach to relieve the pain.<br><br>

In college, I started experiencing the “period flu”—flu-like symptoms every time I menstruated. I once slept 24 hours straight trying to recover.<br><br>

I tried four different birth control brands and multiple regimens (e.g., 2-3 packs in a row), but none worked. I felt like the Goldilocks of birth control—except none were “just right,” and all left me feeling kicked in the uterus by bears.<br><br>

<b>The frustration compounded:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>The endocrinologist who diagnosed me was overbooked—I’d wait for hours.</li>
  <li>My next several providers were gynecologists, and I never saw the same one twice.</li>
  <li>I had to explain my case again and again, only to be told “give it time.”</li>
  <li>I constantly heard: “just lose weight”—as if I wasn’t already trying.</li>
</ul><br>

After every visit, I felt dejected. But I also became stronger. I learned to:
<ul>
  <li>Speak confidently about my symptoms</li>
  <li>Refuse to settle for treatments that didn’t work</li>
  <li>Advocate for new options, not just “give it a few more months”</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Finally, they listened.</b> Four years ago, I stopped the pill and got a hormonal IUD. It stopped my period and the side effects:<br>
✔ No more cramping<br>
✔ No more bloating<br>
✔ No more period flu<br><br>

<b>Important note:</b> I recognize that being a white woman made this process easier. Racial bias in healthcare makes self-advocacy harder for many, with devastating results.<br><br>

<b>Today:</b> My PCOS is still not “under control.”<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>I still deal with original symptoms like facial hair</li>
  <li>I’ve been diagnosed with androgenic alopecia (hair loss from high testosterone)</li>
  <li>I use topical treatments and take 8 pills daily to manage it</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Mentally</b>, PCOS has affected me too. People with PCOS have higher rates of depression and anxiety—both of which I experience.<br><br>

<b>Additionally:</b><br>

  <li>PCOS and fatphobia have distorted my relationship with food, exercise, and body image</li>
  <li>I’m still “overweight” on the BMI chart—but I now know BMI ≠ health</li>

</ul><br>

<b>What I’ve learned:</b><br>
I trust my experience. I advocate for myself. Doctors are experts—but I’m the expert on me.<br><br>

Lived experience matters. And I’ll keep reminding every provider of that fact.<br><br>

You may have heard or read somewhere that the vagina is <b>“self-cleaning.”</b><br><br>

But you’ve probably also noticed that there are a million products out there claiming to clean vaginas. So what gives?<br><br>

<b>First, a quick anatomy note:</b><br>
The <b>vulva</b> includes all the external parts—inner and outer labia, clitoris, etc. <br>
The <b>vagina</b> is internal—where tampons (and other things ) can go.<br><br>

We spoke with <b>Robin Watkins</b>, a nurse practitioner and certified nurse-midwife, for expert advice. Spoiler: <b>you don’t need ANY products to clean your vagina or vulva. Not a single one.</b><br><br>

<b>Here are some guidelines:</b><br><br>

<b>1. Don’t put anything inside that isn’t for pleasure or periods</b><br>
The only exception is if your provider prescribes something—like a topical antibiotic to treat bacterial vaginosis.<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>The vagina is truly self-cleaning.</li>
  <li>Natural vaginal discharge rinses, moisturizes, and maintains a healthy balance.</li>
  <li>Discharge can vary (clear to milky white, slippery to sticky) depending on your cycle.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>What about douching?</b><br>
Don’t do it. Not even with water.<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>Douching disrupts the healthy bacteria and pH of the vagina.</li>
  <li>Even plain water can push harmful bacteria into your uterus.</li>
  <li>Douching increases your risk of infections.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>2. Stick to water for the outside (vulva)</b><br>

Sure, there are “feminine washes” on the market—but not everything sold is smart to use (remember Olestra?).<br><br>

<b>According to Watkins:</b><br>
<blockquote>“The only thing you need to clean your vulva is water.”</blockquote><br>

<b>How to clean your vulva:</b>
<ul>
  <li>In the shower, gently separate your labia.</li>
  <li>Let water flow between and around them.</li>
  <li>Use your fingers to gently rub between the folds of skin.</li>
  <li>Pull back the clitoral hood and rinse your clitoris.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Important Reminder:</b><br>
Your goal isn’t to make your vagina smell like flowers or be completely odorless. That’s a myth sold by the “feminine hygiene” industry.<br><br>

Think of your vagina like a little plant:
<ul>
  <li>Leave it alone most of the time.</li>
  <li>Rinse it occasionally with clean water.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>XOXO,</b><br>
<b>Bedsiderr</b><br><br>

<b>P.S.</b> Something feel off down there? Here’s what to expect from a visit to your provider.

<b>What is normal vaginal discharge?</b><br><br>

After puberty, having vaginal discharge is completely normal. The exact amount varies per person, but <b>normal discharge</b> is:
<ul>
  <li>Clear to white in color</li>
  <li>Has minimal or no odor</li>
  <li>Can be thick, thin, or sticky depending on hormone levels</li>
</ul>

Estrogen levels influence discharge and can vary with:
<ul>
  <li>Menstrual cycle phase</li>
  <li>Birth control methods</li>
  <li>Pregnancy</li>
  <li>Diet and stress</li>
  <li>Sexual activity</li>
</ul><br>

<b>When to see a provider:</b><br><br>

If your discharge changes in <b>amount</b>, <b>color</b>, or <b>odor</b>, or is accompanied by:
<ul>
  <li>Irritation</li>
  <li>Itching</li>
  <li>Pain</li>
  <li>Discomfort during sex</li>
</ul>
…it may be a sign of infection. Some are sexually transmitted, others are due to bacterial imbalance. Always consult a provider if you're unsure.<br><br>

<b>Common causes of abnormal vaginal discharge:</b><br><br>

<b>1. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Caused by imbalance in vaginal flora (natural bacteria)</li>
  <li>Symptoms: thin, grey/off-white discharge with fishy odor</li>
  <li>Triggers: new sexual partner, douching, fragranced soaps, tampons left too long</li>
  <li>May resolve on its own, but antibiotics (oral or cream) are usually recommended</li>
</ul><br>

<b>2. Vaginal Candidiasis (Yeast Infection)</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Caused by yeast (fungus) in dark, moist conditions</li>
  <li>Symptoms: thick white discharge (cottage cheese-like), intense itching, soreness, possible small tears</li>
  <li>Triggers: tight or wet clothing, antibiotics, high blood sugar, estrogen-heavy birth control</li>
  <li>Treatment: antifungal creams or pills</li>
</ul><br>

<b>3. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Most likely STIs to affect discharge: trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia</li>
  <li><b>Trichomoniasis:</b> green/yellow/frothy discharge, odor, itching</li>
  <li><b>Gonorrhea & Chlamydia:</b> may cause greenish or white discharge, often no symptoms</li>
  <li>Must be diagnosed and treated by a provider with antibiotics</li>
  <li>Prevention: use condoms, internal condoms, and/or dental dams during sex</li>
</ul><br>

<b>How to stay safe:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>STIs can exist without symptoms</li>
  <li>Get tested whenever you get a new partner</li>
  <li>Discuss your risk profile with a provider—most people should get tested at least once a year</li>
</ul><br>

<b>The bottom line:</b><br><br>
Most vaginal discharge is normal and expected. But if something feels or smells off, or you’re simply unsure, <b>talk to your healthcare provider</b>.<br><br>

We hear this question (and misinformation on this topic) ALL THE TIME, and we decided that today is the day we’re going to answer it.  

But first, a quick anatomy refresher. Your vulva is all the parts on the outside, including your inner and outer labia and your clitoris. Your vagina is the part that’s on the inside of your body (where tampons and other things can go if you so choose).  

When most people talk about the way their vagina smells, they really mean their vulva. After all, it’s pretty hard to smell something that’s inside your body.<br><br>

<b>What are vulvas NOT supposed to smell like?</b><br><br>

Despite what the “feminine hygiene” (don’t even get us started on how f-ed up that phrase is) aisle at your local drugstore would have you believe, your vulva should not smell like Island Splash, Sheer Floral, Delicate Blossom, Morning Paradise, or Sunset Oasis—whatever any of those things smell like.<br><br>

<b>So what should your vulva smell like, if not a Sunset Oasis?</b><br><br>

We checked in with our on-staff medical provider, Robin Watkins, who’s a nurse practitioner and a certified nurse-midwife, and here’s what she told us:  

“It’s normal for your vagina and vulva to have a smell, just like it’s normal for your underarms to have a smell. Body smells are a part of being human and come from bacteria breaking down sweat on your skin.”  

And there is a range of normal smells. What’s normal for one person may be different from what’s normal for another person. Just like you wouldn’t expect your armpits to smell identical to your friend’s, neither will your vulva smell just like anyone else’s.<br><br>

<b>Is it normal for your smell to change, or is a change always cause for concern?</b><br><br>

It’s absolutely normal for your smell to change. Watkins says that your menstrual cycle, exercising, the weather, having sex, and even eating certain foods, like onions and garlic, can change the way your vulva smells.<br><br>

<b>How do you know if your smell is normal? What kinds of smells could indicate a problem?</b><br><br>

Most smells are normal.  

Smells that could indicate a problem are fishy or sour odors, or any kind of rotting smell.  

The other thing to watch out for is if you have a smell that’s unusual for you at the same time that you have other symptoms, like pain, itching, unusual discharge (especially if the discharge itself has a smell), burning, bleeding when you have sex, or fever.  

If that happens, you should definitely check in with a health care provider because it could be a sign of a more serious problem.  

Also, if you notice an entirely new smell that you’ve never had before, or if your smell is bothering or worrying you, go get it checked out.<br><br>

<b>What should you do if you’re worried about how you smell?</b><br><br>

Assuming that you’ve ruled out any actual problems, your worry is just that—a worry.  

Try to internalize that you are not supposed to smell like nothing, and, as we’ve established, that you’re DEFINITELY not supposed to smell like perfume.  

Whatever you do, don’t resort to using products marketed for eliminating odor.  

According to Watkins: “It’s counterintuitive, but using soaps with a lot of perfume or washing inside the vagina, like douching, can actually upset the balance of the bacteria in the vagina, causing a fishy odor.”<br><br>

In fact—and perhaps we’ve buried the lede here—but neither your vulva nor your vagina need any kind of cleanser!  

That includes even the mildest soap.  

Your vulva only needs to be washed with lukewarm water, and your vagina actually doesn’t even need to be washed with water—it’s self-cleaning. It lives its best life when it’s left alone, like a very introverted and/or feral cat.<br><br>

Ultimately, we’re going to have to learn to accept that people with vulvas and vaginas are humans, and humans have smells.  

It’s fine. We promise.<br><br>

Sex is all about feeling great—until it doesn’t feel great. Unfortunately, dyspareunia (pain during sex) is more common than you might think. In fact, it’s so common that 3 out of every 4 people with vaginas experience it at some point in their lives.

(Although some people enjoy experiencing pain during sex, that’s not the kind of pain we’re talking about. We’re talking about the kind that’s unwanted and a total mood-killer.)<br><br>

<b>First, a few things to know:</b><br><br>

- Sex isn’t supposed to hurt.<br>
- You always have the right to stop if it becomes uncomfortable.<br>
- You don’t have to suffer through pain without help.<br><br>

There are many causes of discomfort during sex—some minor, some more serious—but also many treatments available.<br><br>

<b>Things to try at home first:</b><br><br>

<b>1. Spend more time on foreplay.</b><br>
Giving yourself time and stimulation helps your body get fully aroused, which makes penetrative sex more pleasurable. Take your time and don’t rush it.<br><br>

<b>2. Double up on lube.</b><br>
Vaginal dryness is a common cause of pain. Use water-based or silicone lubricant (not oil-based if using latex condoms). You can apply it anytime—even during sex. Using lube doesn’t mean something is wrong; it simply helps your body feel better.<br><br>

<b>Still hurting? Time to see your provider.</b><br><br>

Take note of where and when the pain occurs, and share it during your appointment. Here are three possible causes:<br><br>

<b>1. You might have an infection.</b><br>
Something like a yeast infection or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can cause pain. Both should be evaluated and treated by a medical provider.<br><br>

<b>2. Your pain may be caused by a gynecologic problem.</b><br>
Some reproductive conditions that cause pain during sex include:
<ul>
  <li>Endometriosis</li>
  <li>Vaginismus</li>
  <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</li>
  <li>Uterine fibroids</li>
</ul>
Birth injuries may also be a cause. Your provider might recommend a pelvic exam or imaging (ultrasound, MRI, or laparoscopy). Pelvic floor physical therapy may help for some conditions.<br><br>

<b>3. Your pain might have a psychological or emotional origin.</b><br>
Sex can hurt if you’re feeling anxious, stressed, or dealing with trauma. In such cases, a psychotherapist—especially one trained in sex therapy or trauma—may be helpful.<br><br>

<b>Final thoughts:</b><br><br>

Whether it’s chronic or occasional, mild or severe, dyspareunia is treatable. You deserve a sex life that feels good.

Experiencing pain doesn’t mean your body is broken. It doesn’t mean you’re not meant to enjoy sex. Don’t push through painful sex—seek answers and support.<br><br>

While you’re figuring it out, it’s okay to explore other kinds of sex that feel better, like oral sex or masturbation. You can still have pleasure—alone or with a partner.<br><br>
