Happy birthday season, Taurus! Confidence doesn’t have to be flashy in order to be attractive. In fact, a hint of birthday sparkle is all you need to catch someone’s eye right now. Subtlety can be seductive, but practice expressing your romantic feelings more openly as the middle of the month approaches—especially under the steamy full moon on May 12th. The new moon two weeks later will put you in touch with your physical desires. Indulge your mind and body.<br><br>

<b>Gemini (May 21st - June 20th)</b><br>
Potential romantic connections within your social life are plentiful during the first third of the month, so make an effort to get out on the town and immerse yourself in the scene—especially before the mid-month full moon swoops in to jumble your schedule.

Step into the spotlight and soak up all that flirty attention.<br><br>

<b>Cancer (June 21st - July 22nd)</b><br>
Social spring-fling energy is powerful this month, especially once the full moon peaks on May 12th and lights up your sex and dating zone. It’s the perfect time to dial up the passion and get your flirt on.

Set some romantic intentions under the new moon on May 26th.<br><br>

<b>Leo (July 23rd - August 22nd)</b><br>
Your work and social life are keeping you busy this month, but make room in your schedule for romance, because all sorts of fantasy-filled adventures are unfolding in your love life. The first week of May is the perfect time to get frisky and try something new in the bedroom, so let your imagination run wild. Once Gemini season starts, add a little adventure to your social life, as the new moon on May 26th is great for kicking off new flirtations.<br><br>

<b>Virgo (August 23rd - September 22nd)</b><br>
Spring is a time to let your freak flag fly and have some fun exploring your sexual side. Just don’t let relationship dynamics get too messy, as it’ll be easy for emotional lines to blur at the beginning of the month. The mid-month full moon inspires open and heartfelt conversations, so say what’s on your mind and be honest with your partner(s). Work picks up at the end of May, making stronger communication a major asset in relationships.<br><br>

<b>Libra (September 23rd - October 22nd)</b><br>
Your relationships are getting a little springtime glow up this month. The first week of May is an especially sweet time to get lost in a fantasy with your lovers and connect with them on a spiritual level. Emotions feel especially deep and intimate during the full moon on May 12th, but you’ll be ready to embrace romantic adventures once Gemini season starts a week later. The end-of-month full moon could bring a meaningful perspective shift in love, so keep your mind open.<br><br>

<b>Scorpio (October 23rd - November 21st)</b><br>
Commitment is on your mind this month, and once the full moon peaks in your sign on May 12th, you’ll be ready to put your desires into words. Feelings are bubbling up to the surface in your relationships now, so don’t be afraid to express what you hope to build with someone. The latter half of the month pulls you into an even more intimate headspace, so find a balance between sharing your vulnerable side and setting boundaries to protect your heart.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius (November 22nd - December 21st)</b><br>
Romance and passion are everywhere you turn right now, and the first week of May is especially dreamy when it comes to love. Let your fantasies lead the way, toward the bedroom and beyond. Once Gemini season starts on May 20th, relationships take the front seat, and you’ll have a chance to bring more commitment to something that was previously lighthearted. Use the new moon on May 26th to get clear on exactly what you’re looking for in a partnership.<br><br>

<b>Capricorn (December 22nd - January 19th)</b><br>
Taurus season’s sensual vibe has you feeling especially romantic this month, and the full moon on May 12th is the perfect time to lean into your more flirtatious side. Send that racy text or talk to a partner about some of your passions. Don’t overbook yourself with dates during the latter half of the month, as your schedule could easily get overwhelming. The new moon on May 26th is the perfect time to take a break from the grind and let off some steam in the bedroom.<br><br>

<b>Aquarius (January 20th - February 18th)</b><br>
Flirtatious energy is all around you this month, and plenty of romantic words could be spoken through the whole beginning of May. Put your feelings into a playlist or a poem. Vibes get especially passionate and playful during the latter half of the month, so prioritize intimate time with your lover(s). The new moon on May 26th is the perfect time to strike up a new romance or spice up an existing one.<br><br>

<b>Pisces (February 19th - March 19th)</b><br>
Get lost in the magic of physical pleasure during the first week of May, as you’ll feel especially embodied in your sensuality. You might want to get extra adventurous during your solo or partnered playtime during the mid-month full moon, as it’ll light up your desire for new experiences. The new moon two weeks later hits much closer to home, and it’s a good time to slow down and embrace some softer and snugglier time with your romantic interest(s).<br><br>

<b>Aries (March 20th - April 19th)</b><br>
You’re attracting love and attention everywhere you go right now, thanks to alluring Venus gracing your sign with its seductive magic all month long. It’ll be easy to get lost in a fun fantasy during the first week of May, but emotions will get real under the mid-month full moon. Get in touch with your vulnerable side. The end of the month brings about an empowering new era in your heart, giving you everything you need to set boundaries in relationships and beyond.<br><br>`

Amorous Venus starts retrograding on March 1st, inspiring everyone to give their romantic life a makeover and reconnect with their pleasures. Two weeks later, Mercury retrograde joins the party, mixing signals when it comes to communication and scheduling.<br><br>

This month also brings back-to-back eclipses that’ll wrap up some meaningful long-term cycles in relationships and kick off some new ones, too. And of course, the spring equinox hits on March 20th, heralding in a refreshing, flirty, and fertile new season ahead.<br><br>

<b>Pisces (February 19th - March 19th)</b><br>
Happy birthday season, Pisces! Venus is retrograding through your pleasure zone all month, encouraging you to adjust the dynamics of your sex life to make sure your current needs are being met. If you want to make a move on a crush or spice up the passion with a partner, take initiative around March 7th. The mid-month lunar eclipse encourages you to release your need for control in relationships and give your hearts space to breathe. Try to stay present instead of obsessing over every detail.<br><br>

<b>Aries (March 20th - April 19th)</b><br>
Romantic Venus is retrograding in your sign all month, so expect to be rethinking your values and the way you pursue pleasure in relationships—and don’t be surprised if you find yourself revisiting love interests from the past. Aries season starts March 20th, so the spotlight is on you, and the solar eclipse at the end of the month is the perfect time to show off all the growth you’ve had over the past couple years.<br><br>

<b>Taurus (April 20th - May 20th)</b><br>
You’re feeling flirty and social through the whole first few weeks of the month, so if you’re looking to meet a fresh face, join a group or do some mingling with friends. The mid-month lunar eclipse is here to teach you free-spiritedness when it comes to sex and dating, so work on letting go of your need to control what other people think and just enjoy the ride. If it’s meant to be, there’s no need to cling onto it.<br><br>

<b>Gemini (May 21st - June 20th)</b><br>
Work and friendships are keeping both your mind and calendar occupied this month, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find time for romance. The lunar eclipse mid-month is a sensitive one, so plan something emotionally cozy with a partner or swipe through the apps from the comfort of your couch. You might find yourself feeling especially nostalgic about love now too, especially once Mercury retrograde kicks off. But that’s a good thing—as walking down memory lane could help you see past relationships in a new light.<br><br>

<b>Cancer (June 21st - July 22nd)</b><br>
Adventure is in the air this month, and being open to new things in the bedroom and relationships in general is exactly what you need to spice things up, especially around the second week of March. Say yes to some passionate new experiences. The lunar eclipse mid-month brings big feelings to the surface, allowing you to speak from the heart and express your needs more thoroughly. Trust yourself.<br><br>

<b>Leo (July 23rd - August 22nd)</b><br>
You’ve got lots of emotions brewing in your heart during the first half of the month, as you’re sifting through some of the beneath-the-surface dynamics of your relationships. Don’t forget to set boundaries as you navigate these big feelings. However, try to get out of your head and get in touch with sensual pleasure during the lunar eclipse mid-month, as it could bring some sexy connections. The latter half of March brings out your adventurous streak, making it a great time for experimenting with new lovers, positions, or date spots.<br><br>

<b>Virgo (August 23rd - September 22nd)</b><br>
Relationships are under a microscope for you this month, but you can use this close-up look to infuse it all with more love and intimacy on a cellular level. Mid-month brings an opportunity to lock things down with someone who’s been casual or take a step toward deeper commitment with a current partner. During the latter third of the month, drill down into the core of your feelings in relationships and own them, especially once the empowering solar eclipse hits on March 29th.<br><br>

<b>Libra (September 23rd - October 22nd)</b><br>
Romantic Venus is retrograding in your relationship zone starting March 1st, and communication-focused Mercury will join the party two weeks later, giving you a chance to restructure the interpersonal dynamics in your love life and revisit past issues with partners with a more confident and empowered approach. Meaningful revelations of the heart come when Aries season starts on March 20th, setting the stage for the end-of-month solar eclipse, which should help you get more comfortable prioritizing your own needs.<br><br>

<b>Scorpio (October 23rd - November 21st)</b><br>
Get ready to get your flirt on, because March is bringing all sorts of opportunities to pump more zest and passion into your life. Step out of your comfort zone in love around March 7th, as it’s a great time to try something new and adventurous with a partner. If you’re single, the mid-month lunar eclipse can help you branch out and open your mind to new people. Once the spring equinox hits on March 20th, look forward to some dreamy romantic fantasies and breakthroughs of the heart.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius (November 22nd - December 21st)</b><br>
Lover planet Venus is retrograding through your sex and dating zone all month, bringing blasts from your romantic past back into your fantasies and DMs alike. Use this energy to help you learn from past mistakes—or perhaps give the hottie who got away a second chance. Things really heat up once Aries season starts on March 20th, especially during the solar eclipse at the end of the month. This fiery energy reminds you that relationships should be fun, so follow your heart.<br><br>

<b>Capricorn (December 22nd - January 19th)</b><br>
This month is a great time to share what’s on your heart, and you’ll be empowered to initiate some really frank and fruitful conversations with your partners around March 7th. Speak your truth and ask for what you need without hesitation. A mid-month lunar eclipse encourages you to loosen up and embrace the adventurous nature of love. Because remember, the heart isn’t an easy thing to control or predict! Sensitivities are high during the solar eclipse on March 29th, so be gentle with yourself and others.<br><br>

<b>Aquarius (January 20th - February 18th)</b><br>
Love has a way of getting us lost in thought, so try to let your body do the talking through the first weeks of this month. You may find that old miscommunications with lovers start resurfacing for another round of discussion, thanks to Venus and Mercury retrograde. But the lunar eclipse mid-month is a time to say what’s on your heart and figure out how to set healthier boundaries. Two weeks later, a fiery solar eclipse helps you find your voice and confidence, so ask out your crush or tell your lover how you’re feeling.<br><br>`

  content: `<b>Valentine’s Day is coming up</b>, and this February’s astrology is as sweet as a heart-shaped box of chocolates. The first week of the month brings a mystical, once-in-a-lifetime alignment of cosmic energies that can connect you with your destiny and turn fantasies into reality. A red-hot full moon two days before Valentine’s Day sets the stage for a passion-fueled celebration. And after nearly three months of backspinning, Mars, which represents energy, action, and desire, finally ends its retrograde on February 23rd, promising higher libidos, more confidence, and a deeper connection to your inner desires.<br><br>

<b>Aquarius<br>January 20th–February 18th</b><br>
Happy birthday season, Aquarius! The first few weeks of the month boost your confidence levels, making it a great time to share what’s in your heart and talk about your desires openly. The full moon mid-month brings loads of heat and passion to your relationships, setting the stage for a red-hot Valentine’s Day, whether you’re linked up or single. The new moon two weeks later is especially sensual, so explore the outer limits of your pleasures and fantasies.<br><br>

<b>Pisces<br>February 19th–March 19th</b><br>
The first week of the month is one of the most magical and romantic periods of the year for you. Pay attention to the signs and symbols that the universe is giving you—particularly when it comes to your love life. You’ll feel more connected to your sensual side leading up to Valentine’s Day, and expressing your desires openly feels much easier once the day comes. Pisces season starts on February 19th, so use the end-of-month new moon to make a sexy birthday wish.<br><br>

<b>Aries<br>March 20th–April 19th</b><br>
Get ready for a romantic month, Aries, because amorous Venus saunters into your sign on February 4th, infusing your aura with an irresistible magic. The first half of the month is packed with social opportunities, making it a great time to meet a sexy new face or introduce your lover(s) to your friends. The mid-month full moon brings passion to a climax, just in time for Valentine’s Day.<br><br>

<b>Taurus<br>April 20th–May 20th</b><br>
This month is an ideal time for you to deepen your relationships with friends, lovers, and family. A friends-with-benefits situation could unfold with magic during the first and last weeks of the month. You might want to take the next step and introduce your partner to your friends or go on a group date. If you’re seeking romance, hit up a Valentine’s Day singles event, as you’ll likely have some good luck. If there’s someone you’d like to ask out or a conversation you’d like to initiate with a lover, you’ll have more confidence to speak your truth during the last week of February.<br><br>

<b>Gemini<br>May 21st–June 20th</b><br>
You’re feeling adventurous during the first half of the month, and the steamy mid-month full moon will give you the confidence you need to ask for what you want. There’s no reason to hide your desires—ask and you very well might receive. Pisces season puts a fire under your career, but once Mars retrograde ends on the 23rd, you can channel your craving for variety into your sensual life by trying something new and wild.<br><br>

<b>Cancer<br>June 21st–July 22nd</b><br>
Love is a wild-hearted dream during the first week of February, so allow yourself to experiment with feelings, positions, and relationship dynamics that you’ve never experienced before. The mid-month full moon lights up your sensual side, so work through your stresses in the bedroom. Once sexy Mars wraps up its retrograde in your sign on the 23rd, you’ll feel even more open to sensual adventures, and the end-of-month new moon is the perfect time to indulge.<br><br>

<b>Leo<br>July 23rd–August 22nd</b><br>
Romance is alive and well for you right now, so pour some extra energy into your relationships this month. You’ll feel an added sense of adventure, pushing you to try new things and be more open to experimenting—especially during the spicy full moon in your sign mid-month. Emotions deepen during the latter half of February, and the new moon at the end of the month can start you off on a new path of vulnerability in love.<br><br>

<b>Virgo<br>August 23rd–September 22nd</b><br>
You’ll be craving depth and intensity in your relationships from the first week of February onward, so seek out authentic connection over surface-level interactions. You’ll feel a lot more fulfilled. The latter half of the month—starting with Valentine’s Day—gets especially romantic, so look forward to a sweet glow-up in your relationships. The fantasy-laden new moon on February 27th is the perfect time to bring magic to a partnership or kick off something new and special.<br><br>

<b>Libra<br>September 23rd–October 22nd</b><br>
Passion peaks during the first half of the month, especially once amorous Venus enters your relationship zone on February 4th. It’s a great time to spice things up with a current partner or initiate something hot and fun with someone new. The mid-month full moon lights up fresh flirtations, making for an emotionally connected and open-hearted Valentine’s Day. The new moon two weeks later opens up some room in your schedule for love.<br><br>

<b>Scorpio<br>October 23rd–November 21st</b><br>
Self-care is an important element of all things in your life this month, especially when it comes to love. Make sure you’re prioritizing rest, health, and wellness in your relationships and personal life alike. Starting on Valentine’s Day, February gets extra romantic, and the rest of the month will be filled with flirtatiousness and plenty of passion. Use the new moon on February 27th to manifest some date nights or pleasure-centric energy in love.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius<br>November 22nd–December 21st</b><br>
Get some Valentine’s Day plans in order, because lover Venus hits your sex and dating zone on February 4th, making romantic connections flow with ease. The mid-month full moon lights up your free-spirited sense of adventure, giving you the confidence to pursue all sorts of exciting new dynamics in love. With this open-hearted energy comes the need for strong boundaries too, and setting those will be much easier once Mars retrograde ends on the 23rd.<br><br>

<b>Capricorn<br>December 22nd–January 19th</b><br>
Sensual energy is buzzing during the first half of the month, and you’ll also find that some destiny-tinged romantic connections could come up during the first week specifically. That random meet-cute or fateful coincidence could mean something more. The mid-month full moon brings up deep and secret desires. Talk them through with emotional openness and allow yourself to be vulnerable.<br><br>`

A little hedonism can be fun sometimes.<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Lucky Jupiter sparkles in your sign for the first half of the year, crystallizing a major glow-up and enhancing your manifestation powers.

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
Lusty Mars retrogrades into your sensuality zone on January 6th, so slow things down in the bedroom and listen more closely to what your body’s enjoying.

<b>Cancer</b><br>
June 21st - July 22nd<br><br>

<b>What to expect in 2025:</b><br>
Magical new opportunities are unlocking in your life this year, Cancer, and you’re embarking on a titillating journey of mental, spiritual, and emotional growth.

Right now, your heart is opening wider than ever—and that’s good, because there’s an abundance of love and romance headed your way.<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Intimacy and emotional entanglements deepen as you kick off the year, but you’ll feel like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon once lucky Jupiter enters your sign in June for its once-in-a-decade visit.

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
Relationships are a big theme now, so once red-hot Mars retrogrades into your sign on January 6th, you’ll need to hold up a mirror to self-doubt and figure out how to stand up for your needs in love.

<b>Leo</b><br>
July 23rd - August 22nd<br><br>

<b>What to expect in 2025:</b><br>
If surface-level love starts to lose its appeal, that’s because you’re being given the gift of perception this year, allowing you to see straight to heart of your desires. Relationships are taking on greater power and meaning in 2025, and the bonds you form with others are one of the most transformative forces in your life now. If you want love, move past the shallow end of the pool and get deep.<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Springtime vibes inspire you to reevaluate your philosophies on love and relationships, while summer’s Mercury retrograde prompts even further self-reflection. Dive into the revelations and you’ll come out the other side even more confident. Stay present with feelings during the lunar eclipse in September, as it opens the door to deeper emotional connections. November’s Mercury retrograde could put you in touch with a past lover for closure, or maybe even a second chance.<br><br>

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
You’re craving deeper and more vulnerable connections as the year begins, as romantic Venus starts lighting up your intimacy zone on January 2nd. The full moon on January 13th is an introspective one, perhaps best spent alone in bed with your favorite adult toys. Once Aquarius season starts a week later, your relationships are a bigger focus, and the new moon on January 29th could inspire a fresh discussion about commitment.<br><br>

<b>Virgo</b><br>
August 23rd - September 22nd<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Romance feels like a dream in late January through early February, and the connection you make now might feel tinged with destiny. Venus retrograde in early spring brings you back to reality, but this allows you to make your fantasies more sustainable. The eclipses in March and September shake up your relationships, so drop your need for perfection and embrace the raw and messy emotions that true love requires. There’s no one right way to do romance, and this year is a time to find what works for you.<br><br>

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
Relationships are getting a glow-up this month, as amorous Venus hits your partnerships sector on January 2nd, making

 it easy to attract what you want in love. By mid‑month, an influx of flirtations will fill your DMs—and perhaps light up your heart a little bit, too. Schedule some date nights during the last third of the month, especially around the new moon on January 29th.<br><br>

<b>Libra</b><br>
September 23rd - October 22nd<br><br>

<b>What to expect in 2025:</b><br>
Taking risks has been paying off for you lately, Libra, and this year brings no shortage of adventures in love and life in general. Mind-expanding new experiences will lead to heart-expanding connections, so look forward to new opportunities in your relationships and career alike. Prioritizing yourself in partnerships isn’t easy, but you’re finding your voice and feeling crystal-clear about what you want.<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Venus retrograde in March has you reflecting on relationship dynamics and seeing love from a new perspective, and the solar eclipse at the end of the month gives you the confidence you need to trust what you see.

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
Between holiday exhaustion and work responsibilities, you may feel like kicking off the year in hermit mode—so go ahead and text your crushes from the comfort of your own bed.

<b>What to expect in 2025:</b><br>
Feeling your deepest feelings also gives you the strength to soar to the highest heights—and this year will take you on a journey through the thrilling extremes of these experiences.

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Your sex life gets a meaningful glow-up during the first few months of the year—and if you open your heart to change, trust that passion will come flowing through. In fact, romance is blossoming in entirely new places all throughout 2025. The lunar eclipse in September challenges you to let go of possessive expectations in love and simply enjoy the vibe instead, while November’s Mercury retrograde holds a mirror to your desires.<br><br>

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
This year kicks off on a beautifully romantic note, as amorous Venus flutters into your sex and dating zone, making it easy to attract all that you desire in love. You may not be feeling as adventurous as usual, but the full moon on January 13th is a good time to gently open your heart to a new experience—but you can temper that with plenty of cuddle time in your romantic comfort zone during the latter half of the month.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius</b><br>
November 22nd - December 21st<br><br>

<b>What to expect in 2025:</b><br>
This year, you’re peeking under the hood of your heart, examining all the nuts and bolts and mechanics that keep the passion flowing through your veins.

There are endless possibilities in love, so expect the unexpected.<br><br>

<b>Key dates:</b><br>
Your sex life gets a cosmic makeover during March, so step back from your usual routine and pay attention to what really gets you excited—especially during the solar eclipse at the end of the month. Romance feels like a fantasy from spring through fall, but you’ll need to practice setting boundaries in order to protect the magic. You may start craving some non‑traditional relationship dynamics starting this summer, so be open to exploration and communicate your desires openly.<br><br>

<b>January forecast:</b><br>
After an eventful holiday season, you may feel more like Netflix‑and‑chilling with your lover(s) rather than getting dolled up for a date night out. Give yourself a chance to rest and enjoy cuddlier romantic connections. Listen to your heart during the full moon on January 13th, as this is a good time to set some gentle boundaries in love. If you’ve got secrets to share, the new moon two weeks later inspires meaningful conversations.<br>

<i>It's Scorpio season</i><br><br>

The astrology of November kicks off with the smoldering and mysterious vibes of Scorpio season, and the intimate new moon on November 1st will put everyone in touch with their deepest desires. A craving for adventure and spontaneity takes over once Sagittarius season starts on November 21st, but lovers beware: Mercury retrograde starts a few days later, and this headache-inducing transit might force you to slow your roll. Beware of exes in your DMs and conversations that could go awry.<br><br>

<b>Scorpio</b><br>
October 23rd - November 21st<br>
Happy birthday season, Scorpio! Make a sweet and sexy birthday wish under the new moon in your sign on November 1st. Your confidence is irresistible and your authenticity is shining. The full moon two weeks later brings a few surprises in your love life, so expect the unexpected in relationships. Change is good! The last third of the month gets you out of your head and into your body, so shake off any post-birthday blues with some fun sexcapades.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius</b><br>
November 22nd - December 21st<br>
Yap your way into your crush’s heart (or bed), as chatty planet Mercury joins love planet Venus in your sign on November 2nd, giving you a clever way with words and an irresistible aura.

Once your birthday season starts on November 21st, your lovers will be likely to oblige. You’re the star of the show.<br><br>

<b>Capricorn</b><br>
December 22nd - January 19th<br>
A friends-with-benefits situation could turn into something more under the new moon on November 1st, or someone in your social group could suddenly catch your eye. Either way, hit the town with your crew for some flirty fun. The sensual new moon two weeks later is packed with passion, and some romantic surprises could be headed your way. Love planet Venus also starts sparkling in your sign mid-month, making it easy to manifest all of your wildest desires.<br><br>

<b>Aquarius</b><br>
January 20th - February 18th<br>
Lusty Mars starts lighting up your relationship zone this month, so don’t wait around for your crush or partner to make the first move. If you want something out of love, go after it with gusto. Some sexy opportunities could arise from simply socializing and mingling with new people once Sagittarius season starts on November 21st. Embrace this free-spirited energy and allow yourself to be a little more spontaneous. Don’t default to saying “no” if your heart wants a “yes.”<br><br>

<b>Pisces</b><br>
February 19th - March 19th<br>
It’s time to broaden your horizons, Pisces—in love, sex, and beyond. Trying new things is a must under the new moon on November 1st, so do something out of the box to bring some zest into a relationship or chase a spark with someone new. The full moon two weeks later could prompt a sudden change of heart or bring about an unexpected conversation. The best way to handle things is by talking them through, so practice being radically honest with yourself and others.<br><br>

<b>Aries</b><br>
March 20th - April 19th<br>
Get ready for a thrilling mojo boost, as lusty cosmic ruler Mars lights up your sex and dating sector starting November 3rd. Whether you’re single or in a relationship, it’s time to take the lead in the bedroom and bring more passion to your playtime. Unexpected sources of pleasure could emerge mid-month, so listen to your body without judgment. Once Sagittarius season starts on November 21st, focus on being more spontaneous in love.<br><br>

<b>Taurus</b><br>
April 20th - May 20th<br>
The new moon on November 1st is a great time to bring more intimacy to your relationships, whether through sex or just open-hearted conversations. The full moon two weeks later is full of unexpected excitement, so look out for some sexy surprises. The latter half of the month also finds love planet Venus in your adventure zone, so seek out new romantic experiences involving people, places, and perhaps even positions you’ve never tried before.<br><br>

<b>Gemini</b><br>
May 21st - June 20th<br>
Amorous Venus is in your partnership zone for the first half of the month, bringing some flirtiness to your love life and making it easy to find common ground with others. Once mid-month rolls around, you may be craving a deeper connection with your lovers, and the best way to create it is by letting yourself get a little more vulnerable. Mercury retrograde could cause some old issues in relationships to bubble up during the last week of November, so be willing to talk it through.<br><br>

<b>Cancer</b><br>
June 21st - July 22nd<br>
Romance is in the air this month, especially under the sultry new moon on November 1st. You’re getting in touch with the lighthearted and playful side of love right now, so follow your heart toward whatever turns you on. Relationships start feeling extra sweet mid-month, allowing you to get closer to a lover or create more connection with a crush with ease. If scheduling snags get in the way of date plans at the end of the month, blame Mercury retrograde. Flexibility is key.<br><br>

<b>Leo</b><br>
July 23rd - August 22nd<br>
Once sexy planet Mars zooms into your sign on November 3rd, expect your libido to skyrocket and your assertiveness to take center stage. You know what you want, and you’ve got the confidence necessary to chase it—so send that flirty text or take the lead with a lover.

Up to you!<br><br>

No need to be so reserved, Virgo—this month is full of flirtatious vibes and lots of opportunities for intimate conversations. The new moon on November 1st is ripe for heart-to-hearts, so share what’s on your mind and don’t be afraid to get vulnerable. The second half of the month is fabulous for dating new people or bringing a sweet spark back into an existing relationship. Not even Mercury retrograde can mess with your mojo now.<br><br>

<b>Libra</b><br>
September 23rd - October 22nd<br>
The new moon on November 1st is a sensual one, and right now, sex can feel more like a spiritual experience if you’re with a partner who understands you. Prioritize pleasure and treat yourself at every opportunity. The full moon two weeks later highlights some of your less-obvious desires, and once Sagittarius season starts on November 21st, you may feel more ready to talk openly about what you want.<br>

<i>Happy birthday, Libra!</i><br><br>

Trick or treat? The astrology of October is serving up a healthy dose of both! A solar eclipse in the partnerships-focused sign of Libra kicks things off on October 2nd, helping us break free of toxic relationship dynamics. Two weeks later, on October 17th, a fiery full moon challenges us to stand up for ourselves and assert our needs in love. Scorpio season comes around on October 22nd, which means raw emotions and radical vulnerability will reign supreme.<br><br>

Embrace the dark and mysterious energy of spooky season, in romance and beyond. Oh, and make sure your birth control of choice is good to go—because the only scares you need this month are of the Halloween persuasion.<br><br>

<b>Libra</b><br>
September 23rd - October 22nd<br>
Happy birthday season, Libra! The solar eclipse in your sign on October 2nd is helping you shed your old skin and release self-doubt—which will allow you to show up in your relationships with more confidence than ever before. The full moon two weeks later shines a light on any codependent tendencies that you may or may not have been aware of. Now’s a great time to set some healthy boundaries in love and speak up for your needs, even if it ruffles someone’s feathers.<br><br>

<b>Scorpio</b><br>
October 23rd - November 21st<br>
Amorous planet Venus is in your sign for the first half of October, infusing your aura with an irresistible charm. Use this seductive magic to attract all that you desire! It’s an especially potent period if you’re looking to tap into your wild side or branch out of your romantic comfort zone—so don’t be afraid to shake things up. Your birthday season starts on October 22nd, and you have full cosmic permission to indulge in every pleasure available to you. Make your lovers splurge on something celebratory and special.<br><br>

<b>Sagittarius</b><br>
November 22nd - December 21st<br>
The heartfelt solar eclipse on October 2nd is shaking up your social life, so don’t be surprised if a friends-with-benefits situation suddenly begins or ends. However, the real action in your love life hits two weeks later, as a feisty full moon lights up your sex and dating zone with climactic passions on October 17th, and amorous planet Venus slides into your sign on the very same day. Look forward to lots of romantic prospects and peak manifestation powers through the rest of the month.<br><br>

<b>Capricorn</b><br>
December 22nd - January 19th<br>
Career shake-ups are keeping you busy through the first half of October, but make sure you’re able to squeeze in some social time, especially if you’re single. You may find that you meet someone special through mutual friends. Passionate Mars is in your relationship zone all month, so making the first move will come more naturally now. The full moon on October 17th is pulling you deep into a cloud of rose-colored nostalgia, so allow yourself to wander down memory lane without overly romanticizing relationships from the past.<br><br>

<b>Aquarius</b><br>
January 20th - February 18th<br>
You love to challenge the status quo, and the solar eclipse on October 2nd is the perfect time to embrace your unorthodox streak in love. Let go of other people’s beliefs and ditch society’s rules about how to conduct relationships—that should be entirely up to you and your partner(s). Two weeks later, romantic planet Venus hits your social sector, making it a fabulous time to hit the town with friends and get your flirt on. A sexy-spooky costume and fun Halloween parties are a must.<br><br>

<b>Pisces</b><br>
February 19th - March 19th<br>
Get ready to dive deep into your psyche and examine your relationships from the inside out, because the solar eclipse on October 2nd is asking you to look beneath the surface of your desires. You’re getting more comfortable with being vulnerable and embracing your truth, so put what you’ve learned into practice. Acting on your passions should be easier than usual, as lustful planet Mars is in your sex and dating zone all month. Your libido is high, and so is your confidence! And once Scorpio season starts on October 22nd, your adventurous streak will be, too.<br><br>

<b>Aries</b><br>
March 20th - April 19th<br>
It’s time to flush out any partnerships that aren’t serving your growth anymore, Aries. The eclipse on October 2nd pushes you to set boundaries and implement the lessons you’ve learned about love. Sensitivities are high mid-month, but instead of acting on every trigger, try to lean into the feeling of vulnerability. The full moon in your sign on October 17th is testing the strength of your relationships, but it’s also teaching you to trust in your own power. You can handle more than you think.<br><br>

<b>Taurus</b><br>
April 20th - May 20th<br>
Lover Venus is lighting up your relationship zone for the first half of the month, so focus on inviting more harmony, connection, and romance into your love life—especially during the days after the October 2nd eclipse. Sudden changes of heart could shake up a partnership mid-month, but don’t fear your feelings or run from the truth. Evolution is a good thing! Emotions run deep during the latter half of the month, so allow yourself to be more vulnerable and focus on trust.<br><br>

<b>Gemini</b><br>
May 21st - June 20th<br>
The cozy autumn vibes are putting you in a romantic headspace, especially during the heartfelt eclipse on October 2nd. You might find yourself making some adjustments to your roster and seeking more balanced and respectful partners who more solidly meet your expectations—and finding them might come more easily than you think! Once amorous Venus enters your relationship sector mid-month, commitments could be on your mind. Are you looking to lock down a cuffing season fling? If so, now’s a good time.<br><br>

<b>Cancer</b><br>
June 21st - July 22nd<br>
The eclipse on October 2nd is plunging you into nostalgia, so it might be time to loosen your grip on some memories of lost relationships. Learning from the past is good, but don’t let it hold so much power over you—especially since amorous planet Venus is in your romance zone for the first half of the month! Combined with lusty Mars being in your sign, this makes it a fabulous month for dating, hook-ups, or infusing current partnerships with more depth and fun. Chase after whatever lights up your passionate side.<br><br>

<b>Leo</b><br>
July 23rd - August 22nd<br>
Communication is extra important to your relationships this month, Leo, so make an effort to put your feelings into words—especially during the eclipse on October 2nd. Holding things inside will only create resentment, so adopt an open-book policy in love. If you’re looking to flirt with some new faces, the latter half of the month is promising, as romantic planet Venus will be in your sex and dating sector, sweetening up your prospects. Get out and enjoy some amorous autumn fun.<br><br>

<b>Virgo</b><br>
August 23rd - September 22nd<br>
Shake off any self-consciousness under the solar eclipse on October 2nd, as this lunation is here to help you feel deeper into your body, whether you’re solo or with a partner. Let go of your inhibitions so you can fully enjoy life’s sensual pleasures! You’ll dive even deeper into this introspective vibe during the full moon two weeks later, so explore the underbelly of your desires and figure out how to move forward without fear. Remember: Your pleasure is never something to be ashamed of.<br>
