  content: `I’ve been some flavor of consensually non-monogamous for over 15 years. During those years, I have had to come out as poly to psychiatrists, therapists, primary care physicians, surgeons, specialists, and nurse practitioners.<br><br>

I’m lucky in that I live in a relatively progressive state and care very little what people think of my personal life, but back when I was a military spouse? I would have been horrified to try to broach the topic.<br><br>

Whether you’re newly poly and coming out to a health care provider you’ve had for years, you’ve been poly for a long time and have a new provider, or anything in between, discussing your relationship orientation or sexual practices with your health care provider can be daunting. That said, it can be an important conversation to have in order to make sure you receive the care you need based on your personal risk factors and behaviors.<br><br>

Keep in mind that for folk in rural areas it can often be harder to find accepting and nonjudgmental care than it is for those of us who live in urban areas. Remember, though, that your health care providers are bound by HIPAA, which means that even if they react poorly, they’re still required to keep patient confidentiality. If you’re concerned about being outed, know that they can’t share your private information without putting their career on the line.<br><br>

Here are some tips for how to come out to your health care provider as polyamorous:<br><br>

<b>1. Be sure that you want and need to have this conversation</b><br>
It’s important to consider why you want to come out to your provider, and if the information is relevant to your care. Do you have multiple sexual partners currently? Do you need an STI test because you have a new sexual partner, but your provider knows you’re married? Does one of your potential partners have herpes, and you’d like to know how to protect yourself and your other partners?<br><br>

If you identify as poly, but don’t currently have any behaviors outside of a monogamous relationship, the conversation may not be necessary (yet). Or perhaps you know it will be eventually, and just want to get it out of the way.<br><br>

<b>2. Decide whether you want to stick with your current provider or find a new one</b><br>
Whether you’ve been going to the same provider or practice since you were a kid like my wife, or you’ve just established a relationship with one as an adult, coming out as poly to a current provider has both benefits and drawbacks.<br><br>

On the one hand, you may already have a sense of how open or judgmental your provider may be or what the best way might be to broach the conversation. On the other hand, it can be harder to have a potentially fraught conversation with someone you have a long history with, and the risk of them reacting poorly may feel higher stakes than it would with a provider you just met.<br><br>

You may already know that you need or want to find a new provider, or your coming out conversation with your current provider may make it clear that you don’t want to work with them anymore. The first step in looking for a new provider is to try to find someone who is already knowledgeable about polyamory, currently has patients who are poly, or who is at least poly-friendly.<br><br>

<b>3. Describe your behaviors, not your identity</b><br>
Poly or non-monogamous can mean a lot of different things in practice, and using these terms without further explanation can lead your health care provider to make assumptions that may not be accurate.<br><br>

Instead (or in addition), consider talking about the behaviors you engage in that may be relevant to your care. For example, you could share the number of current sexual partners you have, what genitals they have, your use of barriers and other safer sex practices, and anything else that seems relevant.<br><br>

<b>4. Prepare a script and practice it beforehand</b><br>
Write yourself a short script with the information you want to cover. Not sure what to say? Here’s a sample script that I’ve used in the past that might help:<br><br>

“Dr. X, I think you should know that I currently (or may in the future) have multiple sexual partners. My partners have X genitalia. I do/do not use a barrier method of birth control with these partners (or I use barriers with X partner and not Y partner). I’m telling you this because I’d like to be able to discuss any risk factors I might have with this information in mind.”<br><br>

Next, practice your script. It may feel a little ridiculous, but practicing what you want to say to your provider can help you feel prepared and confident when the time comes. Whether it’s with a partner or friend or by yourself, take the time to rehearse what you want to say, just like you might do for an interview.<br><br>

<b>5. Know when to walk away</b><br>
It’s an exhausting prospect, but if you go through all these steps, and your provider ends up being judgmental or negative about your choices, it’s important to know when to cut your losses and start again at step one.<br><br>

If your provider is simply ignorant about polyamory, it’s up to you whether you want to take on the job of educating them about it or would prefer to find a new provider who has more experience with polyamory.<br><br>

It can be a long and painstaking process, but finding a health care provider that you are comfortable honestly discussing your romantic and sexual life with is well worth the effort in the long run.<br><br>

  content: `One of the big advantages of telehealth is that it allows you to take care of more intimate health care stuff without having to actually go into the doctor’s office, look someone in the eye, and talk about why you need to get tested. (For example.)<br><br>

While it’d be great if we lived in a world where everyone felt comfortable chatting with their health care provider about their sexual health—and a world where we could be guaranteed that all providers would be non-judgmental and knowledgeable about providing trauma-informed care—we just don’t yet.<br><br>

Also, getting to the doctor is itself an obstacle for many. If you have to take time off work or get child care or drive an hour (or all of the above) to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), it may not be possible to pull it off, even if you’d like to.<br><br>

Luckily, the internet has made it possible to access a range of sexual health services online. Not only can you now get things like condoms and pregnancy tests online, saving you a trip to the pharmacy, you can also meet with health care providers online, get prescriptions, and have medication delivered to you.<br><br>

Here are some options you might want to check out if getting to the doctor is tough for you (or you just dread it):<br><br>

<b>1. Birth control prescriptions and delivery</b><br>
While we’re not at the point yet where we can buy birth control pills over the counter (we’re working on it!), you can get birth control prescribed by a telehealth provider and get your birth control delivered right to your door. There are a bunch of services out there for getting birth control pills without physically going to see a health care provider, including Hers, GoodRx, Lemonaid Health, Nurx, Pandia Health, Pill Club, PillPack, Planned Parenthood Direct, Prjkt Ruby, and Twentyeight Health. Some of these services also offer other types of hormonal BC options, like the patch and the ring.<br><br>

<b>2. Emergency contraception prescriptions and delivery</b><br>
If you need emergency contraception right now—maybe the condom broke or you just didn’t realize you were in the fertile part of your cycle—then it’s best to go to the pharmacy. But you can also get emergency contraception before you need it. And if you’re not interested in getting pregnant any time soon, why not stock up on the morning after pill so you have it in an emergency? So much less stressful. Many of the services listed above that offer birth control also offer emergency contraception.<br><br>

<b>3. STI testing and treatment</b><br>
STI testing is one of those tasks that no one really wants to do, but most everyone really should do. One way to make the whole process easier (and much less awkward) is getting a kit and doing it at home. For at-home STI testing, the telehealth company Nurx offers a variety of options, which you can tailor to your needs. They take most insurance, too! Other telehealth companies that offer at-home STI testing include LetsGetChecked, myLAB Box, and Everlywell.<br><br>

In addition to testing, some telehealth services also offer treatment if it turns out you test positive for an STI. So as you’re deciding which company to use, it might be worth it to see if that’s also an option.<br><br>

<b>4. Herpes medication</b><br>
Whether you’re taking herpes medication continuously in order to reduce the likelihood of an outbreak or you’re taking it to shorten an outbreak that’s already started, you can get your herpes meds online. You can go to Roman, Nurx, and Hers for medication for both oral and genital herpes, while Lemonaid offers it for genital herpes only.<br><br>

<b>5. Erectile dysfunction drugs</b><br>
If you or your partner is struggling with erectile dysfunction (ED), it’s important to get checked out by a doctor. ED can be a sign of a health problem, so it’s definitely worth it to go in and get some tests done to rule out anything serious. But if you’ve already done that and just need to get a prescription for ED meds, Roman is a great site for that. (And they also offer treatment for premature ejaculation, genital herpes, and cold sores.)<br><br>

<b>6. UTI treatment</b><br>
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can be an unfortunate side effect of sex, especially if you have a vulva. Luckily, you can now get diagnosed and treated with antibiotics for UTIs totally online. Check out Lemonaid, GoodRx, and Planned Parenthood Direct.<br><br>

<b>7. Yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis treatment</b><br>
If you’re itching away or having unusual discharge and have a sneaky suspicion you might have developed a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis (BV), you can consult with a health care provider about your symptoms and get treatment via telehealth. For yeast infections, wisp offers one-time treatment or even lets you sign up for regular deliveries of antifungal medication. Another site, virtuwell, offers an appointment and treatment for $49 or less. BV is treated with antibiotics, which you can also get from wisp and virtuwell.<br><br>

With the expansion of telehealth services, it’s easier than it’s ever been to take care of your sexual health. Check out the services we’ve described here to see which, if any, could make your life easier.<br><br>

  content: `Are you dreading your “annual exam”? Not sure how often you need to see a health care provider? Wondering if you can avoid pelvic exams forever? Knowing more about what to expect and how to prepare can help. Even if there’s nothing wrong, you should still see a provider about your sexual and reproductive health needs every year.<br><br>

Depending on where you live and your insurance, this provider might be someone who specializes in sexual and reproductive health care, like a gynecologist, nurse midwife, or nurse practitioner, or it could be your regular primary care provider.<br><br>

Here are the most common questions I hear from patients about annual visits and the answers I give them:<br><br>

<b>There’s nothing wrong, so why am I here?</b><br>
An annual check-in with your provider is a low-stress time to ask all of your questions, get sexual health screenings, like a Pap smear or an STI test, and get general health screenings, like a blood pressure check. Doing these “well visits,” or preventative health services, is a good way to find a provider that you trust. These visits can also help identify any issues and help take care of them before they become a problem.<br><br>

Even better, under the Affordable Care Act, most of these preventative health services, like blood pressure screenings, Pap smears, and birth control, are covered at no cost to you.<br><br>

If you don’t have a provider and need to find one, check out Bedsider’s clinic finder. Making an appointment is usually as easy as double-checking your insurance coverage with the clinic and telling them why you want to be seen.<br><br>

<b>If I don’t need a Pap every year, why do I still need to see my provider?</b><br>
Pap smears screen for cervical cancer and cervical cells that are precancerous. Everyone over the age of 21 should get a Pap smear to check for abnormal cervical cells (sometimes called precancerous cells) that lead to cervical cancer. When these cells are caught early, they can be treated in order to prevent them from becoming cervical cancer.<br><br>

In most cases, you don’t need a Pap smear every year. If you have normal results, follow-up Pap smears are recommended every 3 years until you are 30 and then every 3 to 5 years (depending on whether HPV testing is available as well) until age 65. If you’ve had an abnormal Pap or a positive HPV test, you may need more frequent testing, so talk to your provider about the schedule that is best for you.<br><br>

Even if you’re up to date on your Pap, the well visit is a great time to answer all your burning questions about your sexual and reproductive health, make sure you have a birth control method that is working for you, talk about emergency contraception, and sometimes screen for health conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.<br><br>

<b>My family member had cervical, breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer. Do I need more frequent screening?</b><br>
That depends on the type of cancer and who had it, but it’s a good idea to let your provider know and discuss your family history with them. Here are some things to keep in mind though:<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>In most cases, cervical cancer is caused by an HPV infection. So a family history of cervical cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you need more frequent Pap screening. The best way to prevent HPV infection and cervical cancer is with the HPV vaccine—and a well visit is a great time to get an HPV vaccine—it’s now available for everyone up to age 45.</li><br>
  <li>Breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer can sometimes be related to genes that are passed down in families. Depending on your family history, you may consider screening for these genes. The well visit is a great time to talk to your provider about your family history and discuss whether these screenings are right for you.</li><br>
  <li>A quick note about breast exams: If you do have a concern or a risk for breast cancer, like a family history, providers recommend a breast exam, but the truth is there isn’t good research that shows doing breast exams regularly for people under 25 or more than every few years for people who are under 40 helps prevent breast cancer.</li><br>
</ul><br>

<b>Do I still need a well visit if I’m not at risk for pregnancy right now?</b><br>
Even if you are not at risk for pregnancy because you aren’t having sex right now or don’t have penis-in-vagina sex, an annual visit is a good time to check in with your provider about your sexual and reproductive health.<br><br>

You can talk about your chances of getting pregnant in the future and how to prevent STIs. You can also talk about any problems you’re having with your period and discuss if birth control might help with them—people who aren’t at risk for pregnancy often use birth control for other reasons, like managing heavy periods and improving acne.<br><br>

And anyone who has a cervix should keep up with Pap smears, regardless of whether you could become pregnant.<br><br>

If you’re not having sex right now but you’re considering having sex in the future, think about if you’ll be at risk for pregnancy or STIs. You can then discuss your future birth control and STI prevention needs with your provider during your well visit. That way you can be prepared if you do start having sex.<br><br>

<b>I want to get pregnant, and I’m going to stop my birth control soon. Do I still need to have my well visit?</b><br>
This is the perfect time for a well visit! You and your provider can discuss ways to start a pregnancy in the best health possible, such as starting folic acid supplementation before pregnancy to prevent some types of birth defects.<br><br>

Your provider may order blood work, review any medications you’re taking to make sure they’re safe to continue during pregnancy, and suggest simple changes you can make to be as healthy as possible before getting pregnant. It’s also a good time to talk to your provider about where you can get prenatal care.<br><br>

<b>I hate getting pelvic exams. Will I have to get one at a well visit?</b><br>
If you hate getting pelvic exams, it makes sense that you’d be nervous about a well visit. But if you’re not due for a Pap smear, you may not need a pelvic exam at all—in fact, the entire well visit could be a fully-clothed conversation with your provider!<br><br>

If your provider does recommend a pelvic exam, it’s still your choice whether you get one. Know that you can ask to discuss the exam with them beforehand so that you know exactly what’s going to happen. Let your provider know if you have a history of sexual assault or specific concerns about the exam. You can ask to bring a friend, play music during the exam, and/or have each step of the exam explained to you before it happens. You can also ask to stop a pelvic exam (or any exam) at any time, including right in the middle or when it’s almost over.<br><br>

<b>Bottom line:</b> Most insurance covers an annual health exam, and the well visit can help you cover all your bases. Whether you need a Pap smear, want to start a new birth control (or need refills), have questions about your family health history or what tests might be recommended for you, or you just want to talk—call your provider and schedule a well visit today!<br><br>

  content: `Whether you just moved, are ready for a change, or need to find your first provider, choosing a health care provider can feel daunting. This is especially true when you’re looking for a sexual health provider. But finding a provider that’s a good fit for you and your needs is one key to helping you get the care you deserve.<br><br>

That might mean talking to friends or family about their experiences with their health care providers, checking with your insurance to find a provider in your area, or using our clinic finder to find a provider near you.<br><br>

Here are some things to think about and questions to ask yourself when deciding if a health care provider is right for you:<br><br>

<b>Before you go:</b><br><br>

<b>Do they offer the services you need?</b><br>
Are you looking for birth control? Do you need an abortion? Are you having irregular or painful periods and want to find out why? What you need can help determine the type of provider you should look for.<br><br>

For example, while a primary care provider might be able to test for STIs and give you a prescription for birth control, they may not be able to place IUDs or offer abortion care. So thinking about what services you might need can help you find the right provider. And if you’re not sure what services a provider offers, you can call before you make an appointment to ask.<br><br>

<b>Do they have any special experience or expertise you need?</b><br>
Asking friends or family for recommendations can be helpful. However, someone else’s perfect provider might not be perfect for you (and that’s okay).<br><br>

Think about if there are specific characteristics or skills you are looking for in a provider. For example, some providers have more experience with caring for people who’ve experienced trauma, people with certain medical conditions, or LGBTQ+ people. Figuring out what is most important to you can help narrow down your search.<br><br>

<b>In the exam room:</b><br><br>

<b>How do they talk to you?</b><br>
Even simple interactions can let you know if you feel comfortable with another person. Pay attention to how a provider greets you. Did they introduce themselves? Did they make eye contact? Did they seem to be listening when you talked?<br><br>

<b>Do they respect you as the expert in your life?</b><br>
Every person has different health care needs and preferences. This means that your provider listens to what is important to you and talks with you to make a plan for your care together instead of presenting a one-size-fits-all list of “shoulds” or “musts.”<br><br>

You may decide not to have a certain test or procedure or not to have an exam done in a certain way (or not at all), and that’s okay. A provider who respects you will discuss their recommendations and reasons for making them with you, and they will ultimately respect your right to make your own health care decisions even if they are different than their recommendations.<br><br>

<b>Are they willing to tailor physical exams to help you feel comfortable?</b><br>
Some people are worried or scared about physical exams, especially pelvic exams. If you’ve had a particular exam before, think about what made you most comfortable (or uncomfortable) during it, and tell your provider about it.<br><br>

You may want to have a fully-clothed conversation prior to undressing for an exam, or maybe you want to do the exam first—it’s your choice! Some people like having each step of the exam explained to them as it’s happening, but others may not want to know the details and may be more comfortable putting in headphones or meditating until the exam is finished.<br><br>

The right provider will listen to what’s important to you and tailor the exam so you are comfortable. It’s also okay to tell a provider to stop at any time during an exam, even after it’s started.<br><br>

<b>Can they back up their recommendations with evidence?</b><br>
As important as it is to have a provider who puts you at ease and whose personality clicks with yours, it is also important to know you’re receiving good care. This can be tricky—how can you tell if a provider’s recommendations are following standards and guidelines and are based on good evidence?<br><br>

A good first step is simply to ask why they are making a certain recommendation, such as for a certain treatment, or for one type of birth control over another. Providers should be able to answer those questions in a way that makes sense to you. If you don’t understand, it’s always okay to ask for more information.<br><br>

<b>Final thoughts:</b><br>
Screening potential health care providers to find one that is a good fit for you might take extra work. But in the end, finding a provider you can trust and work with will make your health care visits more comfortable and help you be more in control of your care.<br><br>

  content: `<i>This article originally appeared on Bedsider Providers. While it was written by a provider for other providers, we thought it might be helpful for our Bedsider readers to see as well. We want you to know we’re committed to addressing health disparities, and part of our approach to that work is through provider education.</i><br><br>

From the #metoo movement to reports of sexual assault being front and center on national television with the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, consent has been making the news headlines. Health care providers have an opportunity to provide a safe space to discuss enthusiastic consent in relationships and to model it in the exam room by obtaining explicit consent from our patients prior to performing intimate exams in the office. Consent is an important component of establishing a respectful and trusting relationship with your patient—one that improves satisfaction, adherence, and ultimately, outcomes.<br><br>

Obtaining consent for an exam does not need to mean having a patient sign a lengthy consent form before a pelvic exam is performed. It does involve asking and waiting for verbal permission to touch. <b>Here are a few practical examples of how you can incorporate the language of explicit consent in the exam room:</b><br><br>

<b>1. Greet your patients when they’re fully clothed</b><br>
Sending the message that you care about consent and welcome patients as equal participants in their health care starts before you walk through the door. If your staff asks a patient to undress before you even meet them, you’re taking away their opportunity to consent to each step. You also create a power imbalance where the clothed provider meets a vulnerable, half-clothed patient.<br><br>

<b>2. Ask before you touch instead of tell before you touch</b><br>
Small changes like asking “Is it okay if I touch now?” instead of “Now you will feel my touch,” can make a huge difference in how safe and in control patients feel. You can also let patients defer the exam or remind them it can stop at any point.<br><br>

<b>3. Check in during the exam</b><br>
Elevating the exam table 30 degrees allows eye contact. During the exam, ask “How are you doing?” or “Tell me if you want to stop.” Let patients know, “I’ll stop anytime you ask.” And if they ask you to stop, do so—immediately.<br><br>

<b>4. Offer a chaperone</b><br>
Always offer a chaperone during intimate exams, regardless of your gender. Also, ask for permission before bringing in learners or assistants. Give patients the opportunity to decline privately—before the chaperone enters the room.<br><br>

<b>5. Stop if your patient says “no”</b><br>
If a patient refuses an exam, do not pressure them. Work around it, create an alternate care plan, and explore their concerns respectfully. Listening and validating their feelings builds trust—and avoids violating consent.<br><br>

<b>6. Consent applies to birth control too</b><br>
Respect your patient’s contraceptive decisions, even if they don’t align with your preference. Patients may prioritize factors other than effectiveness. With methods like IUDs or implants, always remind patients that they can have them removed at any time—for any reason.<br><br>

<b>7. Always get consent for an exam under anesthesia</b><br>
Before performing pelvic exams under anesthesia, get explicit consent. Explain the reason, who will be present, and whether students or residents will participate. Learners must meet the patient and receive consent <b>before</b> anesthesia is administered.<br><br>

Respecting our patients by prioritizing communication and explicit consent in the exam room strengthens the patient-provider relationship and ultimately improves health. When patients feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to return for care—and more likely to speak up when something feels wrong.<br><br>

  content: `When you first consider telehealth, you might wonder: when do I actually need to go see a provider in person? Well, that’s a really good question!<br><br>

Because, while telehealth is great for a lot of things, it’s not great for everything. It’s a perfect option for things like getting started on birth control or renewing a birth control prescription, getting tested and treated for STIs, and even getting treatment for UTIs and vaginal infections. But there are going to be times when you really do need to physically be in the doctor’s office in order to get the best health care possible.<br><br>

<b>Here are five times you’ll need to get health care in person:</b><br><br>

<b>1. To get an IUD, an implant, or the shot (or to remove an IUD or implant)</b><br>
There are plenty of birth control options that you can start via telehealth, like the ring, the patch, and the pill. Others don’t require you to see a provider at all—think condoms, internal condoms, spermicide, fertility awareness methods, and withdrawal.<br><br>

But to get an IUD, an implant, or the shot, you do need to see a provider in person. The same goes for removing an IUD or implant. There is a form of the shot called SubQ Depo that you can give yourself at home, but the standard shot (Depo-Provera) requires an in-person visit.<br><br>

<b>2. To treat a recurring or difficult-to-treat infection</b><br>
You can get tested and treated for many common infections through telehealth—STIs, UTIs, yeast infections, and BV among them. But if you’ve already been treated and symptoms persist or return, it’s time to go in person to ensure you’re getting the correct diagnosis and medication.<br><br>

If this is your first time having symptoms, like a UTI or vaginal infection, it’s also better to get diagnosed in person.<br><br>

<b>3. For most abortions</b><br>
If you need an abortion, you’ll likely need to see a provider in person. Some services, like the TelAbortion study (in certain states) or Just The Pill (in Minnesota), offer medication abortion via telehealth—but these are limited.<br><br>

For most people, in-person care is still necessary for abortion services.<br><br>

<b>4. For your Pap smear</b><br>
Pap smears test for abnormal cervical cells that could lead to cervical cancer. This can’t be done via telehealth. Some home HPV testing (like from Nurx) is available, but it’s not a full replacement for a Pap smear.<br><br>

Most people should get a Pap every 3 years, but that may vary if you’ve had abnormal results. If you’re due for one and concerned about COVID-19, ask your provider if it’s safe to wait.<br><br>

<b>5. To diagnose certain conditions, like PCOS or endometriosis, that require more extensive testing</b><br>
Chronic conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or fibroids often require in-person testing—pelvic exams, blood work, ultrasounds, and sometimes surgery. Telehealth is great for managing these conditions, but diagnosing them usually starts in the exam room.<br><br>

A good first step is a telehealth check-in. Your provider can let you know if in-person follow-up is needed.<br><br>

<b>The bottom line:</b><br>
Going to see a health care provider while never leaving your couch is awesome—but sometimes you still have to put on pants and go in person. And that’s okay. Telehealth and in-person care go together like condoms and lube.<br><br>
