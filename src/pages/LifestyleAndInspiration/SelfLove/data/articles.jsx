<h1>5 Things You Can Do to Stop Scrolling</h1>
<h2>For when “touching grass” won’t work</h2>
<br>
Sometimes life does “life things” and it stresses us out. School, work, relationships, family, the news—our stressors have the potential to put us on edge, or keep us awake at night, scrolling with blue light glowing on our faces. Whether you’re scrolling for a dopamine hit of cat belly rubs or doomscrolling to check the latest political news, your phone has an impact on your mood and your mental health.
<br><br>
Part of self-care is not just pampering, but putting ourselves in the best position to handle what life throws at us daily. A friend might tell you to “go touch grass” when you’re feeling aggy, but what does that look like IRL when it’s cold outside or when no one is around to gently nudge you to put down your phone for a bit? We have a few ideas you can try when your brain needs a break from gloom and doomscrolling.
<br><br>

<b>1. Grow something</b><br>
Even if you have a brown thumb, hear us out! It might be too cold to literally touch grass or be out in nature for long, but you can still get the benefits of the natural world inside your home. Becoming a plant parent is a great way to put more life in your living spaces, to lend your energy to caring, and provide a routine, meditative activity for your mind to focus on. Houseplants not your thing? As spring approaches, consider planting window sill herbs from seed, and watch them grow into something you can use.
<br><br>

<b>2. Move your body</b><br>
Exercise can help take your mind off what’s going wrong in the world. You can go to the gym if that’s your vibe, but if you’re more into things that don’t require you to be around others, queue up a Youtube workout. Moving your body can also include doing less strenuous activities like yoga, deep stretching, or tai chi. Combine those with breathwork to help relax you and ease your stress levels. Dancing also counts as body movement. Try setting aside moments where you turn on your favorite album or playlist and dance like no one is watching you—unless your lover is. And don’t forget that sex (solo or partnered) is movement, relieves tension, and can take your mind to a happier place.
<br><br>

<b>3. Pick up a hobby</b><br>
Our phones can be so alluring because they fit in the palms of our hands and have an endless supply of content for us to look at. One way to break that habit is to literally pick up a new hobby to fill your hands and your time. The key here is hobby, not a hustle. Find or revisit an activity that you enjoy doing simply for the sake of doing it. That could look like making art, doing fiber crafts, playing a video game, scrapbooking or journaling, cooking or baking, etc. Just let it be something that holds your attention and your enthusiasm, and the time will fly.
<br><br>

<b>4. Read a book</b><br>
If you struggle with focus, reading a book might be an “easier said than done” kind of ask. Still, it deserves a mention because it’s one of the most immersive forms of entertainment and it is available in various formats and lengths. Find a genre that hooks you and dive in! Don’t feel pressured to go analog if you love digital. Download the Libby app and connect with your local library to borrow ebooks. You can also try audiobooks if listening works better for you than a more traditional format. The bonus of listening to an audiobook is that you can combine it with a low-effort activity, like walking outside or on a treadmill.
<br><br>
One important thing to remember with reading is that if your mind wanders, you might be tempted to check your phone, just for a minute, to see if you missed anything. It might help to move your phone out of sight, out of arm’s reach, or to another room so it doesn’t distract you.
<br><br>

<b>5. Get organized</b><br>
It’s so easy to get sucked into social media and the worlds inside our phones that we might not realize how much time passes as we scroll. The suggestions above are meant to provide you with tips to regularly replace scrolling with something else that could lower your stress level. It’s also useful to organize your time and set parameters for how long you want to be on your phone. You can use apps that track and limit screen time by locking your phone, or you can set timers and reminders via apps to tell you to shut it down, go do something else. You could also get to a task you’ve been putting off for a while…because you didn’t have time, and now you do. Whatever you decide to do when you put down your phone is up to you, even if it’s just to go touch grass.

<br><br>
Fatphobia, a pervasive form of bigotry against fat people, is a beast—a soul-sucking, poopy, lying beast. When you’re fat like I am, fatphobia makes you believe all kinds of things that are untrue and deeply harmful. Like, for example, the idea that thin bodies deserve to be worshiped while fat bodies deserve to be tolerated—especially when it comes to sex.
<br><br>
I know I believed that for a very long time.
<br><br>
Growing up, I was taught by boys at my school that I was unlovable and, frankly, gross. I grew to feel ashamed of my body, hating my double chin, my thick thighs, and my chubby arms. When I received criticism about my body from sexual and romantic partners later on, it didn’t set off any alarms or red flags because I already felt worthless.
<br><br>
“Are you sure you should be wearing that?” was something I heard frequently from one of my first serious boyfriends. I was nineteen. He was, like, 1000 years older than me, but still had the nerve to remind me that the thong panties I’d bought to turn him on weren’t designed for people with my body type—while I was wearing them!
<br><br>
Even when I was in my late twenties, I remember getting ready for a date with someone I’d met online. He brought up sex, and then went onto explain that there were certain things that he only did with thin women—like oral sex. This hurt, but it didn’t shock me even a little. I was no stranger to the idea that I should take what I could get.
<br><br>
No one ever sat me down and said outright, “Virgie, there are two types of women in the world, the kind who are thin and have 100% access to sexual desirability, and the kind who are fat and who get access to, like, 5% of that.” But I can remember moments where that message became clear.
<br><br>
For example, one of my favorite movies when I was a kid was the 1988 film License to Drive, starring none other than Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. There’s a scene where the Coreys were picking out different girls at their high school and deciding what kind of car each one would lose her virginity in. They were attempting to humiliate most of the girls by naming off less expensive, less trendy cars. When they got to a fat girl, though, they said “dump truck.”
<br><br>
Dump truck. Garbage. Dirty. Dispensable. Worthless. I knew that I was like that girl.
<br><br>
Because the Coreys were famous and were the heroes of the film, it made all the stuff that they were saying seem true. Instead of seeing their behavior as a disgusting and unacceptable manifestation of misogyny and seeing them as gross and unappealing, we see those girls through their eyes. They’re presented not as people, but as objects to make fun of and embarrass.
<br><br>
The truth is, if someone believes that different sized people deserve different sexual attention, they suck. Do not date them. Try really hard not to sleep with them (and if you do end up sleeping with one because you’re in a drought—been there!—then give them the most minimal effort possible, lose their number, and absolutely do not follow them on SnapChat). Nothing is wrong with you. Something is very, very wrong with how they see the world. And you don’t need to be around that.
<br><br>
There. Are. Better. People. Out. There.
<br><br>
It took a long time to learn that lesson, but once I did I started to refuse to engage with people who even hinted at fatphobic behavior. I began to ask questions about my potential partners’ beliefs around body worthiness and sex. I adopted a zero tolerance policy around body-shaming comments: no matter how long we’d been seeing each other, if they said one single negative thing about my body they were gone. Cold turkey.
<br><br>
I began to expect my partners to express overt enthusiasm for my body with their words, touch and actions. I went from being a person who felt that my best case scenario was a partner who would tolerate my body to being a person who expected sexual adoration. The more deeply I held onto my boundaries, the easier it was to spot fatphobes from a mile away and the easier it was to spot and nurture connections with body positive partners.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, we all deserve more than feeling tolerated. We all deserve to feel celebrated and desired in the body we have right now. You can stop settling. Right now.

The sad truth is that we live in a culture where it’s still perfectly normal to comment on other people’s bodies. Whether the comment is about another person’s size, age, hair, ability, clothing, skin color, piercings, or gender presentation, there’s a pervasive sense that it’s okay to criticize other people if they “stand out” in some way.
<br><br>
In my experience, people who stand out are often—though not always—members of a marginalized group, like queer people, fat people, sex workers, trans people, unhoused people, people with disabilities, poor people, and people with darker skin. In our sexist culture, it’s also often considered okay for people to comment on women’s and femmes’ bodies.
<br><br>
I grew up with a family that frequently commented on other people’s bodies, especially in public. It was a way that we bonded. My family has experienced a lot of racism and xenophobia. It also has some dysfunctional qualities. So, criticizing others was a way, as negative and maladaptive as it was, that we could let off steam and turn the focus away from ourselves.
<br><br>
My grandfather raised me, and he was the head of our family. He was a really loving and complicated human, but he was also pretty deeply misogynistic and thought it was okay to make fun of women for all kinds of reasons. He also thought it was okay to comment on women he found to be particularly attractive. (Those two things, I’ve found, often go hand in hand.)
<br><br>
I also grew up being made fun of all the time at school. My body was always being judged, and like my family, I felt kind of powerless. So sometimes I would try to get back some of my power by making fun of another person who had less power than I did. The people who had been laughing at me were now laughing at someone else. I felt safe for a few moments, and that felt good.
<br><br>
As a result, I thought it was totally normal when my partners commented negatively on other people’s bodies–especially other women’s bodies–when I started dating. To be honest, I found it comforting. If they were saying mean things about other women’s bodies, then I convinced myself that they didn’t feel that way about me. I did my fair share of being critical and negative, too. I didn’t think twice about it because I believed it was something that everyone did.
<br><br>
And then I started dating someone who just didn’t do it.
<br><br>
We’d be out and about and no matter who we encountered, he just didn’t comment on them. I tested the waters, baiting him by teeing up a critical statement. He’d just shrug and continue on with whatever he’d been doing before.
<br><br>
Wow.
<br><br>
At first, I’ll admit, it was weird and uncomfortable because it forced me to face how often I was being a total jerkbag. I was confused because I’d never dated someone who didn’t criticize others fairly constantly. It made me feel like a bad person when he didn’t engage in the call and response. It turns out, I had been relying a lot on my opinions of others to create opportunities to “bond” (just like I had been taught at home) and to fill in silences. It made me examine my own relationship to silence, and it came back to my upbringing. My family doesn’t feel comfortable with silence, and shaming other people was always a really easy way to get conversation going.
<br><br>
It took a while, but I realized I wasn’t a bad person. We rely on the tools we know how to use. But here I was, faced with an opportunity to try something different. Would I be able to treat it like the gift it was?
<br><br>
It took a long time–several months–to stop going back to the habit, but once I got over the hump I found it incredibly relieving, peaceful, and powerful. I started to become sensitive about it when I noticed others doing it, finally able to feel how hurtful it really was. It changed how I interacted with spaces, because I wasn’t constantly looking for a target. It changed how I interacted with people, because I was able to see more of their complexity. And it changed how I dated.
<br><br>
This non-judgy human had become my new standard without even realizing it. I was able to look back at many of the people I’d dated and see that what we’d done wasn’t bonding. I wasn’t actually safer because they body-shamed other women and femmes. A person who feels like it’s okay to criticize how women or femmes dress or look is a misogynist. When they make fun of other women and femmes, you are not safe. You are just in the presence of someone who is showing you that they’re 100% not here for people like you.

<h1>How to Turn Down Plans Like a Pro So You Can Have a Date Night With Yourself</h1>
<h2>Because you're the most important person in your life</h2>
<br>
There’s no denying the thrill of being surrounded by friends at a lively brunch or getting together for after-work drinks with colleagues after a long week. But there’s another thrill that can feel just as good—the thrill of closing your front door, locking it, and having a night all to yourself.
<br><br>
Don’t believe the anxious voice in your head telling you that turning down plans makes you a bad friend, or that if you say no this time, they may not invite you next time. In fact, prioritizing yourself will help you show up as a better, more present friend when you do hang out.
<br><br>
So here’s your guide to turning down plans like a pro so you can have the best night with the person who matters most — yourself.
<br><br>

<b>1. Own your “Me” time with confidence</b><br>
First things first, embrace the fact that time with yourself is important, and that you don’t need to feel bad about wanting to enjoy your own company. A simple, “I need a night to recharge,” or “I’m having a much-needed date night with myself” can be enough. Be straightforward and confident in your approach. Remember, no one is entitled to an explanation longer than “I can’t make it.” But being honest about prioritizing yourself is powerful.
<br><br>
<b>Example Response:</b><br>
“Hey [Friend’s Name], I’d love to join you all, but I’ve planned a night in with myself that I really need. Thanks for thinking of me though, and I hope you have a blast!”
<br><br>

<b>2. Don’t over-explain (or apologize!)</b><br>
Avoid the urge to fall into the trap of providing elaborate excuses or unnecessary apologies. Over-explaining can make your “no” sound more like a “maybe” and might lead to friends trying to convince you to change your mind. A simple, clear, and concise response works wonders.
<br><br>
<b>Example Response:</b><br>
“Thanks for inviting me, but I’m going to have to pass this time. Hope you have fun!”
<br><br>

<b>3. Suggest an alternative plan</b><br>
If you’re really feeling guilty about missing out on social time, suggest an alternative plan that you can get excited about doing that doesn’t impact the time alone that you need. It could be a coffee date next week or a movie night later in the month. This way, your friends know you still value the time spent with them, but you’re just not available right now.
<br><br>
<b>Example Response:</b><br>
“I won’t be able to make it tonight, but I’d love to catch up over coffee next weekend. How about Saturday morning?”
<br><br>

<b>4. Share your excitement for your solo date</b><br>
Go ahead and let your friends know just how psyched you are for your night in. Talk up your plans with the same enthusiasm you’d have for a hot new restaurant or an epic night out. Normalize spending quality time with yourself and encourage your friends to do the same!
<br><br>
<b>Example Response:</b><br>
“I’m doing a me night tonight, which means all my favorite things—reading, a long hot shower, and falling asleep rewatching Law and Order SVU. I’ll be there next time, for sure!”
<br><br>

<b>5. Harness the power of text</b><br>
Texts are an amazing tool for handling social situations gracefully. They let you communicate your message without the pressure of immediate feedback, and you can carefully craft your response without the potential awkwardness of a face-to-face conversation. Plus, you can ask ChatGPT for help.
<br><br>

<b>6. Avoid the FOMO trap</b><br>
When scrolling through Instagram stories of your friends living it up at the latest pop-up bar, it’s easy to feel like you’re missing out. But their fun doesn’t take anything away from yours. Remember why you wanted a night to yourself and enjoy it without guilt. Embrace the quiet, the snacks, and the pure bliss of not wearing anything from the waist down.

  content: `As the deep freeze of the winter months sets in, many of us are seeking warmth by hiding out under cozy blankets, drinking hot chocolate, and cuddling with our partners. However, there’s an underrated source of warmth that we can’t forget about, and guess what? It’s all over your body. Yep, you got it: body hair!
<br><br>
In a world where there’s intense societal pressure to remove our body hair, especially for women and femmes, let’s explore how empowering (and cozy) it can be to take a break from shaving, waxing, lasering, sugaring, threading, and so on.
<br><br>
<b>First things first. Your body hair is there for a reason.</b><br><br>
Why do we have body hair in the first place? Well, it turns out that human body hair serves a variety of important purposes, from keeping our brains cool (!) to helping heal wounds. Our pubic hair is super important for a number of biological reasons. Our pubes reduce friction when we’re having sex and protect our genitals from germs. Our hair is there to protect us, whether it’s a full head of hair on our heads or stubble in our armpits.
<br><br>
<b>Second, hair removal is a pain—sometimes literally.</b><br><br>
Hair removal procedures like shaving, waxing, or sugaring can cause slight pain, irritation, red bumps, or even skin infections, especially for those who have sensitive skin. And we actually spend our time and money in exchange for this pain and discomfort.
<br><br>
People have different reasons for removing body hair, and whatever the reason, we’re not here to tell you if it’s right or wrong for you. We’re just here to remind you that you have options. And if you do decide to take a break from removing your body hair, the winter might be the best time to do it. Why? Because air gets trapped between the hair and the skin and creates a layer that helps your body hold onto warmth.
<br><br>
<b>
Last, but not least, embracing your natural body hair can foster confidence and self-acceptance.</b>
Letting your body hair grow out can send a powerful message to your own brain that your worth is not determined by how well you conform to mainstream beauty standards. If you’re feeling pressure to adhere to a specific (and unrealistic) idea of what’s attractive, then it may help to take a break from some or all of the ways you’re currently trying to beat your body into submission.
<br><br>
Ultimately, you’re in control and only you can decide what works for you! You might want to shave your armpits but not your legs—or the other way around. You might decide to rock a full bush for a while or test the waters by keeping your pubic hair styled in a landing strip. And your reasons for keeping or getting rid of your hair are all your own, and may change over time. Whether you find hair removal uncomfortable, too expensive, or you want to become more confident in your natural state, that’s cool! And if you want to keep doing whatever you’ve been doing, that’s cool too. There are no rules when it comes to what you decide to do (or not do) with your own body.
<br><br>
But if the idea of taking a break has you feeling intrigued, take some inspiration from the Januhairy campaign, and find out how much growing out your hair can warm your heart (and body).

<h1>How to Put Yourself First This Valentine's Day</h1>
<h2>Best V-Day ever</h2>
<br>
This year, we’re taking Valentine’s Day into our own hands. We think the best way to celebrate is by putting ourselves first instead of waiting for someone else to put us first (although if someone else wants to do that as well, then we’re not saying no!). Here are some ideas to get your best V-Day ever started:
<br><br>

<b>1. Make it a Palentine’s Day</b><br>
There’s no better self-care than time with your besties. Spending time with friends or family members who support and uplift you is a great way to surround yourself with love on Valentine’s Day (or any day).
<br><br>

<b>2. Have an adventure</b><br>
Take the opportunity to do something outside of your normal routine. You can adjust the level of adventurousness here—from trying a new type of food to going to a concert to sweeping yourself off your own feet to go on a spontaneous weekend getaway.
<br><br>

<b>3. Take a break from social media</b><br>
Disconnecting for a little while can be a great reset, and it’s an especially good idea if you’re feeling sad about Valentine’s Day. You don’t need to see all those photos of happy couples!
<br><br>

<b>4. Indulge your inner goblin</b><br>
Have cake for dinner and skip the utensils. Go through the McDonald’s drive-through in your robe. There are no rules anymore, just vibes.
<br><br>

<b>5. Get physical</b><br>
Boost your mood with whatever kind of movement makes you happy. And yes, spicy playtime counts.

<b>6. Write a love letter to yourself</b><br>
The most important relationship is the one you have with yourself, so invest in it this Valentine’s Day. Try making a list of things you love about yourself or writing an encouraging note to yourself. Think about how you’d talk to someone you love, and talk to yourself that way.
<br><br>

<b>7. Make it romantic</b><br>
How many of us have wished someone would plan a romantic night for us, only to be disappointed. So light your own candles, sprinkle your own rose petals, set up a gorgeous bath for yourself, and pour yourself a glass of something delicious.

<h1>How to Take Care of Yourself Right Now</h1>
<h2>If it all feels too hard, you’re not alone</h2>
<br>
Sometimes everything just feels too damn hard. And now is definitely one of those times for a lot of us. If you’re struggling, here are a few things you can do to take care of yourself and possibly also make yourself feel a little better along the way.
<br><br>

<b>1. Open a window</b><br>
Opening a window has transformative powers. Fresh air, possibly some bird sounds, maybe the sound of the wind rustling through some trees—all of these things can help you feel just a little bit less bad when you feel too bad to actually go outside.
<br><br>

<b>2. Listen to some Lizzo</b><br>
It just can’t hurt, you know?
<br><br>

<b>3. Make some art</b><br>
The biggest lie we were ever told is that art has to be good to be worth making. It doesn’t. It can be truly terrible to look at. Just get out some paper and something to draw or color or paint with and go to town.
<br><br>

<b>4. Buy a new toy</b><br>
We’d suggest getting a cute new sex toy just for you (check out our friends at Feelmore for some ideas), but it could really be any kind of toy that floats your boat—you do you!
<br><br>

<b>5. Set limits on your doomscrolling</b><br>
It can be very hard to stop the compulsive news checking when it feels like the world is imploding, so we won’t say once a day is enough, which it almost definitely is. Instead we’ll say set some limits for yourself. The bad news will still be there when you do check, we promise.
<br><br>

<b>6. Do something fun for 10 minutes</b><br>
If you need to set a timer to make yourself do it, then so be it! Just watch your favorite show for 10 minutes, play a little game on your phone, go on TikTok, whatever feels nice.
<br><br>

<b>7. Get yourself a lil treat</b><br>
It’s amazing how much ordering in your favorite pizza or going to get your favorite iced coffee can help.

  content: `Someday, maybe not soon, but someday, you will need to go to a health care provider because one or more of the areas listed below needs medical attention. On that day, you really do not want to be saying to your doctor things like, “My coochie meow meow itches” or, “My dingleberries have a rash.” Not only will your provider not know what you’re talking about, but it’s just not a great look for an adult to be too embarrassed to say the names of their own body parts.

So yeah, you’ve got homework. Practice saying each of the words on this list 10 times. Once you’ve mastered that, practice in front of someone else (someone who consents to this exercise, please) to up the ante a little bit. And if that feels easy to you, practice saying to someone else, “My _____ feels warm and fuzzy.”

<h1>7 Rules for a Body-Positive College Experience</h1>
<h2>Everything you need to know as a freshman</h2>
<br>
So it’s your first semester in college, and you’ve probably already survived a few exciting-slash-terrifying moments. I remember when my grandparents dropped me off to start my freshman year at the University of California. I couldn’t get them out of my dorm room fast enough. I was ready for freedom, dining hall cookies, and, honestly, some of the sexual experiences I had definitely not been having in high school.
<br><br>
Everyone had told me that college was where chubby nerds like me really got to have their moment. And they weren’t wrong. I had some of the mythical experiences I’d been dreaming of back in my small suburban town. I was ready for some of them, but honestly, being raised by conservative Christian helicopter parents didn’t prepare me for most of the experiences I was about to have.
<br><br>
In addition to my lack of sexual experience, I had super low self-esteem (thanks, fatphobia). I was constantly on a diet, worried about the “freshman 15,” and terrified that my body wouldn’t measure up to social standards. I waded through a lot of confusion, guilt, shame, and a glaring need for boundaries. In hopes that you don’t need to go through all that, I decided to make this list to offer you the rules I wish I’d had when I started my life as an undergraduate:
<br><br>

<b>1. You have the right to assert that your body is unbelievably precious.</b><br>
This is the cardinal rule. Every single body is precious. Every single body matters. Say it with me! You’re going to get literally quadrillions of messages that will attempt to deny the reality of this basic, fundamental truth (because: capitalism, sexism, racism, white supremacy, advertising, ableism, transphobia, fatphobia, and lots of other trash). Your biggest job is to ignore them by any means necessary. If I feel like I’m losing my way, I simply bring myself back to one question: “What would I do in this situation if I believed that I was precious beyond belief?”
<br><br>

<b>2. You have the right to recognize that talk of the “freshman 15” is fat-shaming (& that’s not cute)</b><br>
You’re going to hear a lot of fear-mongering around weight-gain and your first year of college. Feel free to not only ignore it, but call it out for the messed-up, fatphobic bigotry that it is. You have the right to eat what you want, when you want, and in the amount that you want. For many people, college is the first time their families aren’t monitoring what and how they eat. That can be incredibly freeing. We should celebrate that, not live in fear of it. Your body is good, worthy, and valuable no matter your size or how you eat. Period.
<br><br>

<b>3. You have the right to make “enthusiastic consent” the norm for EVERYTHING you do with your body</b><br>
Here’s a definition of consent that I like (from YesMeansYes.com):<br><br>
<i>“Consent is a mutual verbal, physical, and emotional agreement that happens without manipulation, threats, or head games. Consent is a whole body experience. It is not just a verbal ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it involves paying attention to your partner as a person and checking in with physical and emotional cues as well.”</i>
<br><br>
Adding enthusiasm to this definition means that you are not only verbally, physically, and emotionally agreeing to something happening, but that you are, in fact, stoked about it. High bar, I know, but it’s kind of the key to a rad life. It’s my personal standard, and I highly recommend it.
<br><br>

<b>4. You have the right to protect your body from unwanted touch or experiences</b><br>
If someone is saying something that makes you feel weird or acting in a way that doesn’t feel right, you don’t have to explain yourself. You can just leave. Always. Even if you’ve been making out with someone for seven hours, you do not owe another person one more minute than you want to give them.
<br><br>

<b>5. You have the right to NOT be low-maintenance</b><br>
You never have to go with the flow or “be chill.” “Chill” is a word that has been coopted by misogynists everywhere in an attempt to get femmes and women to stop asserting their wants and needs. There’s a real premium placed on being, remaining, and staying low-maintenance and not asking for what you want and need. Guess what? Your wants and needs matter. They are information from your body, informed by your past experiences and your desires for the future.
<br><br>

<b>6. You have the right to make a plan that keeps your body (and mind and spirit) safe</b><br>
I am the biggest fan of planning. You can’t anticipate every event that’s going to happen while you’re in college, but there are certain things that are inevitable: conflict, disagreement, desires, and boundaries. When you are clear on what you want—and what you for sure don’t want—it’s easier to set guidelines for how to keep yourself safe. It helps a lot to write these things down and place them somewhere visible.
<br><br>
My friend has this wall of notes she keeps in her bathroom. There are different categories, like “things I’m avoiding” and “things I want to do.” Toilet time is her reflection time. You may not have the luxury of your own private bathroom for this, but find a space that is your own—like your journal or the wall above your work space—to keep track of things like people, places, and ideas that make you feel good in your body as well as those that don’t.
<br><br>

<b>7. You have the right to experience pleasure in your body</b><br>
Pleasure is a human right. It can come from spending time with people you love, eating yummy things, touching trees, petting puppies, a good night’s sleep, orgasms, and/or sex had with enthusiastic consent. Pleasure is your body’s way of telling you, “Yes, keep doing this!” Feelings of dread, fear, or reluctance are your body’s way of telling you, “Stop this immediately, please!” Listen. If you have OCD or anxiety, which might make it harder to sort through and make meaning of these kinds of feelings, take the time you need, preferably with the support of a therapist, to figure out what feels safe and good for you and what doesn’t.
<br><br>
Growing up believing that a woman’s job was to pleasure her man really put a damper on my sex life. Until I started dating someone who pointed out to me that I really was allowed to have a good time, it had never occurred to me that sex was meant to be pleasurable for women too. This revelation completely rewired my brain. So, let me pass on to you this piece of information: sex is not an act of service. Sex is an act of shared pleasure. Don’t feel shy about telling your partner(s) what you like and how to make you feel good.
<br><br>

This list could be a lot longer and probably still not cover the unique needs that your body has. Add what you want. Talk with friends about how they take care of their bodies. Make checking in with your body—its needs, wants, and limits—a consistent part of your college experience. In the next two or four years, you could totally graduate as a full-fledged expert in Body Autonomy (that was a BA joke, sorry).

<h1>7 Self-Care Activities That Only Take 5 Minutes</h1>
<h2>And will make you feel a little bit better</h2>
<br>
Phew, are y’all okay? Because we’re not, and we don’t really know anybody who is right now. From covid to climate disasters to threats to abortion rights, it really feels like we’re stuck in a one step forward, two steps back kind of situation. Even when we know we still need to take care of ourselves, it can be hard to figure out what that means at this point or how to do it.
<br><br>
So we’ve laid out a few really easy places to start. Pick one of these and do it right now, and your future self will thank you.
<br><br>

<b>1. Clean one thing</b><br>
You can actually get a surprising amount done in 5 minutes and setting a timer makes it easier to just do it, since you know it’s a tiny commitment. Just do one thing, like stacking up the papers on your desk, or picking up the clothes on the floor and putting them in a pile.
<br><br>

<b>2. Have a good cry</b><br>
Sometimes the best thing you can do to take care of yourself is to allow yourself to feel your feelings. If that means crying, all the better, because crying emotional tears actually releases endorphins and flushes out stress hormones.
<br><br>

<b>3. Read some good news</b><br>
Here, we’ve got some for you!
<br><br>

<b>4. Play your favorite song</b><br>
If singing is your thing, go on and belt it. If dancing is your speed, flail it out, honey. We find it’s best if no one is around so you can really let loose.
<br><br>

<b>5. Put on lotion</b><br>
Moisturizing is always good—you know we’re fans of lubrication in general. Go for something that smells really nice if you have it. The more senses you can engage, the more grounding the experience will be.
<br><br>

<b>6. Cut your fingernails</b><br>
No it’s not Instagrammable self-care, but it is self-care, and you will almost certainly feel better after doing it. Unless you go too short and then you’ll be cursing our name for a few days.
<br><br>

<b>7. Light candles</b><br>
Light a few candles and place them around the room. If it’s dark out or you have really good curtains, consider turning off all the lights and just sitting in a totally candlelit room for a few minutes. The flickering and the warm glow can be really soothing.
