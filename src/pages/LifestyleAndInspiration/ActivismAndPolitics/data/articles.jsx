<h1>5 Reasons Why Birth Control Should Be Over the Counter</h1>
<h2>Let's free the pill, finally!</h2>
<br>
Let’s use our imaginations a little, shall we? Let’s imagine a world where things are getting progressively easier for people with uteruses instead of harder. Where policies are in place that support all people’s ability to determine if and when to start a family. Where everyone has access to the tools they need to take care of their bodies in the ways they want to. Where privilege isn’t the price of entry for reproductive freedom. Where birth control is easy to get.
<br><br>
This is the world that we, personally, would prefer to live in, and it’s the world we’re trying to build. That’s why we’re part of Free the Pill, a campaign to make the birth control pill available over the counter (OTC), meaning without a prescription. We’re presenting you with our top 5 reasons why the pill should be OTC in the hopes that you’ll join the movement too.
<br><br>

<b>1. It’s safe and effective</b><br>
It’s the same birth control you know and love, only you don’t have to have a prescription to get it. It’s as safe as other medications that are sold over the counter, and it meets the FDA’s criteria for over-the-counter sale.
<br><br>

<b>2. It saves you time and money</b><br>
It can be super hard to get to the doctor (or other health care provider) even under relatively easy circumstances. And it’s even harder when you’re working multiple jobs, working while in school, have kids and don’t have childcare, can’t afford the copay, don’t have money for gas or other transportation, or face other very common barriers. Birth control shouldn’t just be for people with privilege. You shouldn’t need to have lots of money and free time to control your own reproductive future.
<br><br>

<b>3. It gives you more control</b><br>
Ready to go on birth control? Great! Why should there be ten roadblocks to overcome between you and your first pill? Imagine if you could simply go to the pharmacy and pick it up like you would condoms, allergy meds, or ibuprofen. You’d never have to worry about running out because your prescription expired and you couldn’t get in to see your health care provider for a week.
<br><br>

<b>4. Health care providers think it’s a good idea</b><br>
Prominent medical associations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians agree that birth control should be available over the counter.
<br><br>

<b>5. It’s already over the counter all over the world</b><br>
The United States is behind much of the rest of the world on this issue. The birth control pill is OTC in over 100 countries around the world.
<br><br>

Feeling inspired to take action on this issue? There’s plenty you can do to make your voice heard.

      content: `Any form of birth control is better than no birth control when it comes to the environment. But let’s look a little closer at the claim that hormones in birth control are getting into the environment through pee. The simple answer is: yes, it is. But—and this is a big but—it is small compared to other sources of estrogen. Current research finds that the contribution of EE2 (the primary active ingredient in the pill, the ring, and the patch) to the total amount of estrogen in of our waterways is small. Bigger—much bigger—sources of estrogen in the environment come from industrial and manufacturing processes; agricultural fertilizers and pesticides; the drugs we give livestock; and the waste and runoff produced by these sources. Simply removing hormones from contraceptives will not eliminate the environmental impacts of estrogenic compounds. It’s much better to buy organic food if you can and even better to tell Congress to do its job and regulate chemicals, than to forego birth control. From Mother Earth’s standpoint, any form of birth control is better than no birth control.For purists who don’t want to add any hormones to the environment or to their body, no matter how small, there are options for you. Natural latex condoms and the copper IUD are two frequently cited examples of ultra-green contraceptives.
<br><br>
<a>Still not working?</a>
<br><br>
If you’d like to use a super effective method without any hormones, try the Paragard IUD.`,

<h1>4 Things You Can Do for Texas Right Now</h1>
<h2>The most restrictive abortion law in the country has taken effect, and Texans need our help</h2>
<br>
You’ve probably heard that Texas just enacted one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.—blocking nearly all abortions after just 6 weeks of pregnancy. This law especially hurts low-income individuals, people of color, and rural communities. But while the situation is urgent, you are not powerless. Here are 4 immediate actions you can take to support Texans and reproductive rights nationwide:
<br><br>

<b>1. Talk about it</b><br>
The Texas abortion ban quietly slipped through mainstream coverage. It’s critical that we speak out and raise awareness. Talk to friends, family, coworkers—make sure they know what’s happening. With other states watching closely, public pressure matters more than ever. Show lawmakers that their voters care about abortion access.
<br><br>

<b>2. Contact your Senators in support of the Women’s Health Protection Act</b><br>
There’s hope at the federal level. On September 24, 2021, the U.S. House passed the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA). This bill would block harmful state laws like the one in Texas and ensure that abortion access is protected nationally. But for it to take effect, the Senate must pass it too.
<br><br>
Please take two minutes to send a message to your Senators. Tell them you support the WHPA and demand federal protections for abortion rights.

</ul>
<br>

<b>3. Donate to those helping Texans access abortion care</b><br>
Abortion is still legal outside Texas, but for many Texans, traveling to another state is expensive, complicated, or impossible without help. That’s where abortion funds and support networks come in—they cover costs like transportation, hotel stays, child care, and the procedure itself.
<br><br>
If you’re able to donate, these organizations are making an immediate difference for real people navigating barriers to care. You can give to a specific fund or have your donation automatically split across multiple Texas-based abortion funds.

    content: `<p>For nearly 10 years, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) contraceptive coverage requirement has helped millions of people get the birth control they need without out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles. But for nearly as long, legal challenges on behalf of employers who object to providing this coverage for their employees have threatened this critical benefit. In July of 2020, the Supreme Court allowed regulations put in place by the Trump administration to go into effect that permit nearly any employer to object to covering some or all methods of birth control. But the good news is that the Court essentially said that the Biden-Harris administration also has the authority to put in place new regulations to enforce the contraceptive coverage requirement. It’s time to take action. Here’s where things stand and how you can help make sure everyone has coverage for the birth control they need without cost barriers.</p><br>

<p><b>Birth control is widely used and wildly popular</b><br>
Everyone loves birth control. The majority of adults—regardless of race/ethnicity, region, and political affiliation—support access to all methods of contraception. This includes 95% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans. And 76% of adults believe that birth control should be considered basic health care. This isn’t surprising considering 99% of women in America who have ever had sex have used some form of birth control at some point in their lives. So it makes sense that the idea that birth control could be unaffordable because a person’s insurance doesn’t cover it is extremely unpopular.</p><br>

<p><b>Why is no co-pay coverage so important?</b><br>
Before the ACA became law, not every employer was required to cover birth control in the employee health plans they offered. Even when birth control was covered, some methods may have been excluded, or the out-of-pocket costs made them too expensive for some people. As a result, people sometimes had to choose their method based on what they could afford, rather than what was best for them. On average, before the ACA became law, women spent between 30 and 40% of their total out-of-pocket health costs just on birth control. It wasn’t uncommon to see a price tag as high as $40 per month, even with insurance. That kind of price put birth control out of reach for many people struggling to make ends meet, including college students and young people.</p><br>

<p>We know there are many factors that go into a person’s choice of birth control method and that not every method is right for every person. It’s a journey, and what’s right for each person may change over time. The median number of methods ever used by women in the U.S. is three, and one-third of women have used five or more methods.</p><br>

<p>The ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement has allowed more people to choose the method that’s best for them without having to pay additional out-of-pocket costs. Research shows that having this coverage helps make it possible for people to pick the method they want based on the factors that are important to them, rather than having to choose based on cost.</p><br>

<p><b>So what’s the problem?</b><br>
In 2018, the Trump administration issued regulations allowing employers and universities that cite a religious or moral reason to refuse to include birth control in employee or student insurance plans. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that these regulations could go into effect. For people with employer-sponsored health insurance where the employer objects to covering birth control, it’s as if they don’t have any insurance coverage when it comes to birth control.</p><br>

<p>In addition, as new methods of birth control become available, we know people sometimes struggle to get their insurance plan to cover those methods. Finally, we know that over-the-counter methods like some forms of emergency contraception and internal condoms are not covered by insurance unless you have a prescription. This is already a problem for people using those methods, and it could become an even bigger problem in the future if some birth control pills become available over the counter. If you or someone you know is having problems getting birth control covered by insurance, you can go to <a href="https://coverher.org" style="color:#028388" target="_blank">coverher.org</a> for help. But we need to fix these policies so everyone has the birth control coverage they deserve.</p><br>

<p><b>What Can You Do to Help?</b><br>
The Supreme Court ruling that allowed these regulations to go into effect was a setback. But while the Court said that the Trump administration could enact those regulations, it also said that other presidential administrations could alter them. President Biden committed to undoing the Trump birth control regulations, and we need to urge the Biden-Harris administration to move forward with this work, and to make sure the new rules they put out will cover the full range of birth control methods—including new methods and over-the-counter methods.</p><br>

<p>Good news—we’ve made it easy for you to take action. You can send an email to the Biden-Harris administration, urging them to undo the Trump birth control rules and fix the contraceptive coverage requirement:<br>

    content: `<b>We here at Bedsiderr love any chance we can get to celebrate freedom in all its many forms.</b> So we’re super excited that today is Juneteenth! If you’re new to this holiday, no worries—this is literally the perfect day to learn all about it and celebrate it for the first time.<br><br>

<b>Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865</b>, the day that enslaved African-Americans in Galveston, Texas learned the Emancipation Proclamation had set them free two years earlier. Union army general Gordon Granger shared the news when he read aloud General Order No. 3 to proclaim liberty for all people in Texas and informed them the Civil War had ended two months prior. News took a lot longer to travel back then, and slave owners were taking advantage of that to keep people enslaved. Juneteenth (or Jubilee Day) celebrations began yearly among African-American communities in Texas in 1866. The unofficial holiday gradually spread around the country over the next century.<br><br>

Over 150 years after it came into existence, Juneteenth is now experiencing a resurgence in public awareness as the country undergoes a national reckoning on racism. Because of this heightened social awareness, many companies like Nike, Twitter, Square, and Vox Media are making Juneteenth a paid corporate holiday. But you can still join the celebration even if you don’t have the day off—freedom is for everyone!<br><br>

<b>Here are some ways you can get free on Juneteenth:</b><br><br>

<b>1. Eat a traditional African-American meal</b><br>
What is a holiday without a delicious feast to share with family? In the 1860s, enslaved people often ate culinary staples like collard greens, sweet potatoes, and tea cakes. Since Juneteenth is a born-and-bred Texan celebration, don’t forget the barbecue!<br><br>

<b>2. Listen to testimonies of freedom, struggle, joy, and the African-American experience</b><br>
Early Juneteenth commemorations included singing spirituals and hymns. Featuring essential songs from artists such as Nina Simone and Kendrick Lamar, this generation-spanning Juneteenth 2020 playlist on Spotify is a treasure. See also: this amazing audio library of speeches by African-American activists put together by American RadioWorks.<br><br>

<b>3. Contribute to modern-day freedom movements</b><br>
The ongoing fight for reproductive justice is a sobering reminder that full liberation is a process, rather than a destination. Black women and femmes often face high rates of reproductive discrimination in the United States. You can learn more, join the fight, and donate to reproductive justice organizations like SisterSong to help.<br><br>

<b>4. Cozy up with a book by a Black author you haven’t read before</b><br>
Anti-racist books are all the rage right now. If you’re non-Black and you want to educate yourself on racism, spending Juneteenth with your nose in a book is one way to start. But don’t feel confined to nonfiction books that unpack oppression. The fiction of Amiri Baraka, Octavia Butler, Jesmyn Ward, and Rion Amilcar Scott is essential reading, too.<br><br>

<b>5. For Black people: Rest. For allies: Re-commit to change.</b><br>
Frankly, racism is exhausting. And while Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom, it was merely the beginning of a long battle for African-American equality. That fight rages on, and it’s going to take everyone to win it. We’re inspired by The Nap Ministry’s mission of “rest as resistance” for Black people. Meditate, go outside and take deep breaths, lose your worries in something beautiful. Get free where you are. Happy Juneteenth!<br><br>

XOXO,<br>

    content: `<b>UPDATE:</b> President Biden has opened the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act health insurance plans for 2022. You can now enroll in one of these plans until January 15, 2022, at healthcare.gov. Some states have their own open enrollment periods and websites for signing up. Check to see if your state does.

<b>—</b><br><br>

<b>Pop quiz:</b> Say you’re child-free and living in Arkansas on $4,000 a year—can you get healthcare through Medicaid?<br><br>

Today the answer is probably no. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), that may be changing.<br><br>

<b>Expanding Medicaid through the ACA could mean health coverage for 15 million uninsured Americans.</b><br><br>

Take action now to let your Governor and state legislators know where you stand.<br><br>

The ACA is working with states to give more low-income Americans the option to get healthcare through Medicaid. If every state expands Medicaid to the level proposed by the ACA, it could mean coverage for roughly 15 million people currently without insurance. Getting more people insured is a win for states and for the country as a whole—it would mean money saved over the long term, not to mention healthier people with better access to birth control and other preventive services.<br><br>

In Arkansas, Gov. Mike Beebe says he wants to take the federal government up on their offer and expand Medicaid in his state. That could mean a single Arkansan with no kids making as much as $14,000 a year could get health coverage through Medicaid. But the state legislature isn’t sold on the idea so, while Gov. Beebe hopes to find a solution, it’s not clear yet whether Arkansas will expand or not. Arkansas isn’t alone there—lots of states are still on the fence about whether to take advantage of the offer.<br><br>

<b>Which is where you come in.</b><br><br>

Governors around the country are starting to submit budget proposals to their state legislatures—which means as you read this article, your Governor may be deciding whether or not to include Medicaid expansion in that proposal. State legislatures are also starting to work on their state’s budget for the coming fiscal year.<br><br>

A few states, like California and Massachusetts, are already expanding Medicaid as the ACA offers. But in most states the deal is far from done.<br><br>

<b>Take action. Right. Now.</b><br><br>

USA.gov makes it easy to contact your governor—all you have to do is select your state, then fill out the online form and insert your comments, or click on the link to email your governor (different states have slightly different formats). You can also reach out to your state legislators—the Library of Congress website sends you to the homepage of your state legislature where you can click on your state on their handy map (or the name of your state below it). When you get to the homepage, go to the place on that page where you can find your state legislators and enter your zip code or address to find out who represents you. Click on those legislators and you should find email addresses.<br><br>

A personal message or story about why this issue matters to you can make a real impression. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy offers fact sheets for every single state with details about the cost of unplanned pregnancies and how many births were Medicaid-funded in that state. You can use information from your state’s fact sheet to show why the expansion would save your state money. You’re also welcome to help yourself to this handy, customizable sample message:<br><br>

<b>Dear [insert title and name of governor or state legislator]:</b><br><br>

I’m writing to urge you to expand Medicaid coverage for uninsured Americans in [insert state], as the Affordable Care Act offers. Expanding Medicaid would improve the health and economic well-being of people in our state while at the same time saving money by reducing state and local costs for health care for the uninsured.<br><br>

Expanding Medicaid would also mean better coverage of preventive care, including contraception, for millions of people across the country. Medicaid currently covers 41 percent of all births nationwide. In [insert your state] [insert percentage of births that are Medicaid-funded in your state] percent of births are Medicaid-funded.<br><br>

By providing health coverage for many low-income people who are currently not insured, we can ensure that they have access to basic, cost-saving preventive care, including preventing unplanned pregnancy, which currently costs taxpayers $12 billion a year, and costs our state [insert cost of unplanned pregnancy from your state fact sheet].<br><br>

Please do what’s in the best interest of our state and our country and expand Medicaid in [insert state].<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>
[Insert name]<br>
[insert your city and state, or full address if you’d like a reply]<br><br>

Your Governor and state legislators need to hear from you—let them know that expanding Medicaid coverage through the ACA makes economic sense and will improve the health and well-being of people in your state. Then keep track of your state’s progress with this lovely map, updated daily!<br><br>

      content: `<b>The Trump administration’s gag rule has taken effect nationwide.</b> It affects all clinics that participate in the Title X program. If you want to take action on this issue and have your voice heard, join our campaign to protect Title X. Read on to find out more about what the gag rule means for you:<br><br>

<b>What is Title X?</b><br>
Title X (pronounced: “Title Ten”) is a federal grant program that provides low-cost or free family planning services to people with lower incomes who don’t have insurance. Title X doesn’t cover abortions, but it does cover birth control, Pap smears, STI tests, and breast cancer screenings.<br><br>

<b>What is the gag rule?</b><br>
The gag rule prevents Title X clinics (any clinics that accept Title X funding) from referring patients to get an abortion or even directly telling them where they can get one. It also eliminates the requirement that Title X clinics provide what’s called “nondirective counseling” to any pregnant patients. Nondirective counseling means talking to pregnant patients about all of their options, including continuing the pregnancy, parenting, foster care or adoption, and abortion. Under the gag rule, all pregnant patients have to be referred to prenatal care, whether they want it or not.<br><br>

If you specifically ask for an abortion referral, providers aren’t allowed to give you one. They are allowed (but not required) to give you a list of comprehensive health care providers, some of which can provide abortions. However, they can’t tell you which ones on the list, if any, actually do provide abortions. They’re not even allowed to physically point to the ones that offer abortions. Also, the majority of providers on the list can’t be ones who provide abortion.<br><br>

As a result, Title X clinics have been forced to choose between:<br>
– No longer accepting Title X funding if they don’t want to be subject to the gag rule<br>
– No longer taking Title X patients, which means it will be much harder for patients with lower incomes to get the full range of reproductive health care<br>
– Or no longer offering complete and accurate medical information to their patients<br><br>

If they no longer take Title X funds, they may be forced to charge higher out-of-pocket costs even for patients who struggle to afford care, shorten clinic hours, limit the services offered, or even close their doors.<br><br>

<b>How does the gag rule affect you if you’re pregnant and don’t want to be?</b><br>
Now that the gag rule has taken effect, if you go into a Title X clinic and you’re pregnant and already know you don’t want to be, you’ll be referred to prenatal care. If you ask for an abortion referral, the provider won’t be able to directly give you one, and instead will be required to give you a list of other providers with no indication of which ones, if any, offer abortions. That means you’ll have to call every single one yourself instead of just being referred to one clinic that your provider recommends for an abortion.<br><br>

<b>How does the gag rule affect you if you’re NOT pregnant?</b><br>
It may sound like this is no big deal if you aren’t trying to get an abortion. But the gag rule will also impact patients who have been getting other services from Title X clinics that now have to close or otherwise put limitations on the services they offer. In some places, the only clinic available might be a Title X clinic, and if it closes, there will be nowhere nearby to get health services like birth control, cervical cancer screenings, or Pap smears.<br><br>

This is a big deal because 19.5 million women already live in contraceptive deserts, which means that they don’t have reasonable access to a public clinic that offers them a full range of birth control options.<br><br>

The gag rule will also affect people who have been getting other services besides abortion from clinics that are staying open but opting out of the Title X program (like Planned Parenthood) because these clinics may have to start charging more for their services. Birth control that was once free may now come with a price tag. Call your clinic before you go to find out if anything has changed, like prices, the services they offer, or the hours that they’re open.<br><br>

<b>How can you find a clinic where you can get an abortion?</b><br>
Your best bet for finding an abortion provider is to use Bedsiderr’s clinic finder. Click on the orange plus sign next to “show health centers with…” and check the box for “provides abortions.” Providers at these clinics will be able both to counsel you on abortion and provide an abortion. However, this list is not totally comprehensive, so there are some abortion providers that are not on this list.<br><br>

If you want to go to a clinic that isn’t on this list, it’s important to make sure it’s not a fake clinic (also known as a “crisis pregnancy center”) first. Fake clinics are designed to convince pregnant people to continue their pregnancies and do not provide comprehensive reproductive health care. Take a look at this list of fake clinics before you go to make sure the one you’re going to is a legitimate health care provider.<br><br>

<b>What can you do to stop the gag rule?</b><br>
If you want to take action on this issue, join our campaign (through Power to Decide, our mom organization) to protect Title X.<br><br>

This is a huge victory, but keeping birth control affordable doesn’t stop at protecting coverage through private insurance. <b>Publicly funded programs like Medicaid and Title X</b> are crucial to keep birth control accessible for people of all income levels and circumstances across the country. <br><br>

<b>Want to know how crucial?</b> Almost 9 million women, especially women with lower incomes, rely on publicly funded contraceptive services.<br><br>

<b>Title X and Medicaid: A birth control safety net for millions of women</b><br><br>

Title X Family Planning funding has been key to building a network of family planning centers across the country. These centers can include community health centers, local health departments, Planned Parenthood affiliates, and outpatient clinics. If you’ve had the benefit of receiving contraceptive care without insurance coverage, or using an income-based sliding scale to determine how much you’ll pay for birth control, you may be one of the four million people who can thank Title X for helping make their care affordable each year.<br><br>

Medicaid is free or low-cost health care coverage for millions of people, based mainly on income. Many women get full health coverage through Medicaid, which includes family planning services. But Medicaid expansion, which was adopted by over 30 states as part of the Affordable Care Act, makes it possible for women who don’t qualify for general Medicaid coverage to get family planning services too.<br><br>

Even with current levels of Title X and Medicaid funding, over 19 million women already live in areas without “reasonable access” to the full range of birth control methods. (“Reasonable access” basically means there are enough health care providers to meet the needs of the population.)<br><br>

<b>Cuts or restrictions</b> to either program will only make that number bigger and will most impact the women who can afford it least. This is why it’s so important to let your elected officials know that you want them to protect funding for both programs.<br><br>

<b>How can you help?</b><br><br>

If the fight to protect insurance access has taught us anything, it’s that our voices can effect change! Members of Congress are on August recess, which means your elected officials are back in their home states listening to constituents like you.<br><br>

If you don’t know who your senators and representatives are, visit the <a href="https://www.senate.gov">U.S. Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.house.gov">U.S. House</a> websites to find out. Once you’ve got names and contact information, you can call them, visit them, or attend their town hall meetings.<br><br>

To demonstrate how easy it is to contact your elected officials, our policy intern Yema-Juliet created a video to walk you through the process:<br><br>

<b>Try this easy script:</b><br><br>

<b>Step 1: Introduce yourself</b><br>
<i>Staffer:</i> Good afternoon, Representative Robinson’s office, this is Rachel speaking. How can I help you?<br><br>
<i>You:</i> Hi Rachel. My name is [your name] and I live in [city + zip code]. May I speak with Representative Robinson or the staff member who oversees health care issues?<br><br>

<b>Step 2: Share your story</b><br>
<i>You:</i> Thanks. My name is [your name] and I’m a constituent. I’m calling to ask that Representative Robinson strongly support public funding for contraception, specifically the Title X Family Planning Program and Medicaid. Given recent attacks on these programs, I’m very worried about the ability of all women, regardless of income, to have access to the full range of birth control methods. Birth control gives women like me the power to decide our futures, and my ability to get affordable birth control has helped me to get the education and career I have today.<br><br>

<b>Step 3: Close the call</b><br>
<i>Staffer:</i> Thanks. Representative Robinson has not yet decided how she’ll vote, and much will depend on what else is in any legislation before her. I’ve taken down your comments though, and I’ll pass them along to the Congresswoman.<br><br>
<i>You:</i> Thanks Rachel. This issue affects my daily life, and I’ll be following the Congresswoman’s votes on Title X funding and the Medicaid program closely. I appreciate your time.<br><br>

<b>Final thoughts:</b><br>
As we fight to protect birth control access for all who need it, it’s important to remember that <b>we have power</b>. Just like we used our voices to make sure our elected officials knew we opposed rolling back the ACA, we can continue to hold them accountable.<br><br>

<b>Birth control access for low-income Americans is in danger.</b><br><br>

On June 16th, the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Subcommittee passed its version of the FY 2016 spending bill. The bill eliminated all $286 million in federal funding for the Title X Family Planning Program—a program that helps millions of low-income women and men access affordable contraception.<br><br>

<b>The only good news:</b> This is just the first step in the process, so there’s still time to help save Title X.<br><br>

<b>That’s crazy—what can I do?</b><br><br>

<b>Step 1:</b> Reach out to your Representatives and Senators ASAP to tell them you support the Title X program. If they are on the House or Senate Appropriations Committee, this is even more important. Ask them to fully fund Title X at $286 million for FY 2016.<br>
(<a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative" target="_blank">Get your Representative’s contact info</a> | <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm" target="_blank">Get your Senators’ contact info</a>)<br><br>

<b>Step 2:</b> Share your birth control story on Instagram or Twitter using the hashtag <b>#BirthControlHelpedMe</b>. This campaign launched today to raise awareness about why birth control matters to real people.<br><br>

<b>Wait, what’s Title X?</b><br><br>

The Title X Family Planning Program has been around for a long time—since The Beatles, The Jackson 5, and Sly & the Family Stone were at the top of the charts. For more than 40 years this program has helped low-income women and men access sexual and reproductive health care.<br><br>

The publicly-funded family planning services provided at Title X clinics save taxpayers $7 billion per year.<br><br>

<b>How?</b><br>
Title X clinics help people prevent unwanted pregnancies. Many of those pregnancies would result in births that taxpayers would pay for through Medicaid.<br><br>

<b>Let’s do the math:</b><br>
The average cost for one Medicaid-covered birth (prenatal care, delivery, postpartum care, and one year of infant care) is <b>$12,770</b>, while the annual per-client cost for publicly-funded contraceptive care is about <b>$239</b>. That means U.S. taxpayers save at least <b>$6 in public sector medical costs for every $1 spent on contraceptive care</b>.<br><br>

<b>There’s still time to take action!</b><br><br>

The full House Appropriations Committee still needs to vote on the bill Wednesday, and the Senate will begin work on their version of the 2016 spending bill on Tuesday. <br><br>

So there’s still time to tell your members of Congress what you think.<br><br>

📞 <b>Call your Senators and Representatives</b> and tell them why Title X is so important.<br>
📢 And tell the world why birth control is important using the <b>#BirthControlHelpedMe</b> hashtag.<br><br>
