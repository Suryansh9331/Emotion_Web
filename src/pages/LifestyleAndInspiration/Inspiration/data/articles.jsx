  content: `<b>3 ways to level up your successes in 2025</b><br>
<i>New year, same you! In a higher resolution</i><br><br>

We’re a few weeks into the new year, and it’s the perfect time to check in on your resolutions. Did you make any this year? If not, don’t fret. December and January are traditionally when people reflect on the past 12 months and pick apart what they’d like to change about themselves. And those things can feel endless: fitness, money goals, eating habits, sexy travel bucket lists and more. Along with the pressure of those resolutions comes the not-so-subtle assumption that we’ll abandon most of them by Valentine’s Day. But what if we imagined the New Year’s spirit as a higher resolution of our best qualities? Say, 4K?<br><br>

Contrary to popular belief, it’s a myth that we form habits in only 21 days. It can reasonably take weeks or months for new resolutions to stick. Broken resolutions can feel discouraging to some people because they expect a habit to form sooner than their body or mind is ready. But one way to start the New Year off right is to sharpen your successes from 2024. Think: New Year… Same You! It doesn’t have to be either/or. You can still have fresh resolutions and prepare to repeat some of last year’s high points.<br><br>

So, what should go in a “New Year…Same You” strategy session? If you’ve already tallied off your highlights from last year, you’re ahead of the game. But don’t worry if you haven’t—2025 still has that “New Year” scent on it. You have plenty of time to pick out any areas or categories that went well, that you can either build on or replicate. Write those down in a list if you’re a list-making person, or draw a grid if you need things spread out visually.<br><br>

Then, consider what you would need to do to continue that trend or give it more attention. Will you need structure or support? Enlist all the tools you have available, including tech, planners, and accountability partners. The most important thing is to dive into what gives you a sense of accomplishment. Your mileage may vary, but here are a few examples on how to stay consistent or apply pressure to the areas where you rocked in 2024.<br><br>

<b>Sexual health</b><br>
You finally found a birth control method that fits your body, your lifestyle, and your needs? Congrats, bb! Let’s keep that hot streak going. If you’re on the birth control pill, set a series of reminders in your favorite app to take your pill daily. You can also set a nudge to let you know when to start a new pack after your 21-day or 28-day pack ends. Getting the birth control shot means making an appointment, which can sneak up on you if you let it. Get that appointment ticked off your list now with a phone call, so that your next shot is booked in your calendar. This can especially help if your provider’s office has a busy schedule and is booked for months out. Oh, and consider this a reminder to check the expiration dates on your condoms.<br><br>

<b>Relationships and dating</b><br>
If you rang in 2025 with someone who made you feel fireworks last year, first of all, LFG! Enjoying love is always a great resolution. “Relationship goals” doesn’t have to focus on how people see your relationship from the outside. Check in with your partner and think of ways you both can deepen and strengthen your connection. Spending more quality time? Supporting each other in your personal goals? Fine-tuning your communication? Or, if you’re a hopeless romantic, pencil in surprises on your secret calendar to show your lover how much you care throughout the year.<br><br>

For those of you wading in the dating pool, besides having a blast in your single era, now is a great time to review your green, pink, and red flags. Our desires and preferences shift over time. Did you have any dating experiences last year that might have changed from pink flags (small concerns) to red flags (big, glaring, no-go warnings)? Consider what kinds of dating approaches worked or turned you off. Keeping an open mind can help your love life, but if you discovered a dating hack that works for you, ride it til the wheels fall off!<br><br>

<b>Friends and family</b><br>
Think of your best moments of 2024. Were they filled with the laughter of friends and family? We love that for you. Let’s do it again in 2025 by being intentional about connecting with loved ones. You may or may not have a holiday hangover for now, but try to plan for the next time you or your BFF(s) can get together. It doesn’t have to be a big event. Think coffee, tea, walks in the park, a museum outing, a movie, or even a phone call date to catch up now that vacations are over. Use January to get started on the memories you’ll cherish at the end of 2025.<br><br>

Of course, there might be other things about 2024 that you wouldn’t mind continuing. Focus on the aspects of your life you already love, on the things you do well, and on the people who encourage you to be great.<br>

<i>It’s time to get creative, babes</i><br><br>

Winter is in full, freezing effect, and depending on where you live, snow might be blanketing the ground. Or, it’s just cold as a polar bear’s pinkie toe without the added benefit of snow to play in. Either way, it’s the time of year when couples bundle themselves inside and get frisky…or get antsy. What do you do when date night may have to be inside for a few weeks? Cabin fever doesn’t have to make you sick of seeing your partner’s mug! Here are three ways you can turn feeling cooped up into a hot time.<br><br>

<b>1. Melt some chocolate</b><br>
Chocolate might be winter’s sweetest treat (sorry, marshmallows!), so it’s the perfect ingredient to mix in with your cabin fever. Making s’mores is a cute activity to do with your sweetheart. Stock up on graham crackers, marshmallows, and the star of the show: bars and bars of your favorite kind of chocolate. No fireplace? No worries! You can find an electric tabletop s’mores maker at your local retailer, or you can use a cookie sheet with a conventional oven.<br><br>

But if you’re not a fan of s’mores, there’s still plenty of chocolate fun to be had with your lover. Make hot chocolate the slow, sexy way with cocoa powder and melted chocolate chips. Don’t forget to nibble at the chocolate morsels—and at each other—while you’re doing all that stirring.<br><br>

If hot chocolate is not your kind of foreplay, there’s one more chocolate-based activity that might get things steamy without involving steamed milk. Whip out the chocolate syrup, some sprinkles, whipped cream, and head to the bedroom, to make it a sundae fun day.<br><br>

<b>2. Have sexy storytime</b><br>
Most people know about Netflix and Chill by now, but sometimes it’s not as easy as it sounds. Who can agree on what to watch these days? And what if you sped through all your favorite shows already (cough, cough, Bridgerton)? This is where you might need to look outside the box and inside a book for your next tandem entertainment.<br><br>

Find a sexy, romantic book and take turns reading it to each other over a few nights. Even better if the book has a split narrator between the main character and the love interest. Cuddle up on the couch wearing something cozy or sensual, and enjoy the sounds of each others’ voices. You can make your storytelling playful during the steamiest parts of the novel…tap into your inner naughty librarian. And when sparks inevitably start to fly between the lucky couple, watch them heat up between you and your lover.<br><br>

<b>3. Play a win-win game night</b><br>
If you and your partner have been cooped up for a few days, you might need to work out some pent-up aggression. There’s more than one way to get your lick back. Time to break out the games for a little more-than-friendly competition. Any video game you can put on two-player will work. Or go old school with board and card games: checkers, Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, or even stacking games like Jenga.<br><br>

Play in rounds, with the loser having to remove an article of clothing for each round they lose. You can also include sexy dares for bonus points. This might be another chance for you to literally get your licks in. The first player with no clothes on…well, wins. You and your partner can decide what the prize or “funishment” will be. Either way, on this kind of game night, everyone wins!<br>

  content: `Yep, it’s a lot like the American one, but these particular fools have British accents. Which does help a little to be honest. But the accents don’t stop things from getting REAL awkward on <i>Love Is Blind UK</i>. Here are the five absolute worst (aka best) moments:<br><br>

<b>1. Nicole meeting Sam</b><br>
Oof, y’all. We may never have witnessed anything this painful in our lives. And we hope we never do again. The look of horror in Nicole’s eyes as she realized who she just got engaged to is unmatched. Except why did she have to see him to realize she’d made a terrible, terrible mistake? The personality was the problem, babe.<br><br>

<b>2. Tom’s lipstick moment</b><br>
Love a bold lip on a man. But this was more of a bold lower half of his face. And Maria’s a makeup artist! This career blunder for Maria: NOT very mindful, NOT very demure. However, the fact that Tom didn’t care (and he was very insistent that he did not care) was pretty cute.<br><br>

<b>3. Sam describing a book about his life</b><br>
During Nicole’s very long blackout in which she thinks she loves Sam, she unfortunately prompted him to talk about himself, asking him what his life will have been like when he looks back on it at age 90. Inexplicably, unimaginably, beyond our wildest dreams, his answer was:<br>
“I think if I could put it into a book, it would be a book that would be one of the best books that someone could ever read. Because the chapters of that book would entail a love story of romance that would be so beautiful it would make you cry…?”<br>
And somehow this wasn’t what made Nicole run for her life.<br><br>

<b>4. Jasmine’s mom’s wedding dress</b><br>
This was a wedding dress, right? She wore a wedding dress to her daughter’s wedding? And then when Jasmine complimented her, she responded by saying she couldn’t let Jasmine outdo her. On Jasmine’s wedding day. It’s definitely sad that this woman is so jealous of her daughter, but she says some of the most out-of-pocket things ever said on any season of <i>Love Is Blind</i> in any country, and she should probably stop.<br><br>

<b>5. Freddy funeral directing his wedding</b><br>
Freddy is nothing short of a delight. But it is actually extremely awkward how smoothly he managed Cat’s parents and Cat herself after leaving her at the altar. Once you realize he’s funeral directing, you just can’t unsee it.<br><br>

So, all in all, kind of boring.

  content: `Going out can be intimidating, especially when staying home in a teddy bear onesie and watching Netflix sounds really great. But variety is the spice of life! Getting out of your comfort zone and having new experiences can be a great way to meet new friends, find a new favorite spot, or simply have an occasion to put on a cute outfit. Whether you’re hanging out with friends or flying solo, here are some tips for going out as an introvert.<br><br>

<b>Go to events that are your speed</b><br>
First things first, find events that you think will be fun for you! Check out local clubs and bars for parties that might spark your interest. Clubbing not your thing? Try going to trivia nights or board game cafés, or consider joining hiking groups, crafting circles, or other interest-based groups. You can find events on EventBrite or Meetup.com. You can also find hobby groups on social media for music, sports, animé, arts, fashion—you name it. Don’t feel like traveling far or not able to? Look at the event calendars of different venues in your area to see what’s happening near you.<br><br>

<b>Do your research</b><br>
Doing some research before you go can help you feel more prepared for a night out. Here are some things you might want to consider before leaving the house:<br><br>

<b>Vibes:</b> Check out a place’s reviews or their social media page. Do the vibes of the place match what you want?<br>
<b>Accessibility:</b> What does accessibility look like in this space? Does it have seating? Ramps? Quiet spaces to go to when feeling overwhelmed? Restrooms? Will people be testing or masking?<br>
<b>Weather:</b> What’s the weather going to be like? Is it an indoor or outdoor venue? Hot girls don’t get cold…but maybe bring a jacket just in case!<br>
<b>Food:</b> Will food be available for free or for purchase? Do you want to eat in advance? Will there be foods that meet your dietary restrictions?<br>
<b>Area:</b> Research the surrounding area. Do you think you will feel safe spending some time walking to your car or waiting on a ride? Does the area get a lot of foot traffic? Share your location with a friend or family member for extra safety, especially if you’re going to an unfamiliar area by yourself.<br><br>

<b>Don’t forget the essentials</b><br>
It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and forget something you need. Create a checklist of all the items you want to bring with you before leaving the house. Of course we have the usual suspects: ID, keys, wallet, phone. But you might need other things such as cash, an umbrella, a water bottle, or tissues. If you’re on a birth control method that you use every time you have sex, toss that in your bag in case things get spicy. If you’re on the pill or another medication, set an alarm on your phone so you won’t forget to take it while you’re out and about. Make sure you’ll have access to water if you need to take a pill. And don’t forget condoms or internal condoms for STI prevention.<br><br>

<b>Do what makes you comfortable</b><br>
Try to get to the event a little early so you can get acclimated to the space before it gets crowded. This would also be a good time to locate any restrooms and water stations. Don’t be afraid to bring items that make you feel more comfortable, like ear plugs if you’re going to be in a space with loud music or sounds. Make sure to listen to your body and give it what it needs. This can look like sitting down when you get tired, using a fan when it gets too hot, or moving to a quieter area when you feel overwhelmed. Finally, it’s okay to leave if you are not having a good time. If it sucks…hit the bricks! Don’t feel pressured to stay in a place where you feel uncomfortable. Your health and safety are most important.<br><br>

<b>Be yourself</b><br>
Introverts can feel pressure at times to be more outgoing, but honestly the best thing you can do is be yourself. You don’t have to be the life of the party! It’s perfectly okay to wallflower a little and take things at your speed. Trust me, you are not the only person who’s nervous or feeling a little out of their element. Just relax and take in the scene. There’s something really cool about people coming together to have a good time.<br><br>

Don’t forget to plan downtime afterwards to rest and recharge.<br><br>

You got this!<br><br>

  content: `<b>Want to celebrate Pride but not really a party person?</b><br><br>
Here are five ways to show your support for the LGBTQ+ community that don’t involve going to the club or dealing with huge crowds.<br><br>

<b>1. Support smaller events</b><br>
There is more to do during Pride besides go to big, colorful parades and parties in crowded clubs. If you want a Pride experience that’s a little more artsy, cozy, or educational, consider attending events hosted by local LGBTQ+ artists or smaller LGBTQ+ organizations. These events can include:<br>
• Art shows<br><br>
• Dance classes<br><br>
• Open mic nights<br><br>
• Craft festivals<br><br>
• Film screenings<br><br>
• Pop-up thrift shops<br><br>
• Workshops<br><br><br>
Smaller events also tend to focus on the intersectional experiences of LGBTQ+ folks, exploring themes around race, nationality, disability, religion, and more.<br><br>

<b>2. Read books written by LGBTQ+ authors</b><br><br>
Don’t feel like leaving the house? Stay inside and snuggle up with a good book! From memoir to fantasy to romance, LGBTQ+ books span all genres. Not sure what to look for? Here’s where you can start.<br><br>
• Bonus points if you pick up a book from a LGBTQ+ or feminist bookstore!<br><br>
• If you are part of a book club, suggest that your next book be by a LGBTQ+ author.<br><br>

<b>3. Volunteer at a local charity</b><br>
Another great way to celebrate Pride is to give back to your local community. This can include:<br>
• Working at food pantries<br>
• Helping run fundraising events<br>
• Making care packages<br><br>
Volunteering is a great opportunity to get involved and meet new people.<br>
(And remember: you can volunteer year-round, not just in the month of June!)<br><br>

<b>4. Tell your legislators to protect LGBTQ+ rights</b><br>
There have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced over the past few years. These include bans on drag shows, books, and gender-affirming care.<br><br>
One way to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights this month would be to learn about these bills and contact your state legislators:<br>
• Visit the ACLU website to track legislation in your state<br><br>
• Use Plural’s website to find your state and federal legislators<br><br><br>

<b>5. Give the LGBTQ+ folks in your life extra love!</b><br>
