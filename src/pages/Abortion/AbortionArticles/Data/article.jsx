  content: `There is no one-size-fits-all answer for how painful a medication abortion is. Some people experience very little pain, like mild period cramps, and some people experience very intense pain, which feels more like the pain of the contractions you’d have when giving birth.
<br>
If you’re having a medication abortion, you can take over-the-counter pain medication, like ibuprofen, or you can ask your provider to prescribe pain medication for you to take at home. In addition to pain medicine, you may find that using a heating pad, taking a hot shower, or other techniques like breathing exercises and meditation can also help with pain.
<br>
While the pain with a medication abortion can last longer than with an abortion procedure, many people find that the pain improves after they pass the pregnancy. If your pain isn’t getting better or is getting worse after you pass the pregnancy, contact the clinic where you had your abortion.`

The first medication stops the pregnancy from continuing to develop, and the second medication starts the abortion process. You take the second one someplace safe and comfortable with easy access to a bathroom up to three days after taking the first medication. Once you take the second medication, the abortion usually starts within an hour and can take up to several hours to be complete. With the abortion procedure, the actual abortion typically only takes five to ten minutes.`

One way to do this is for your abortion provider to give you anti-anxiety medication that you take by mouth before the procedure to relax you. You will be awake but should be more relaxed than usual. If you have what’s called “conscious sedation”, you’ll be awake but extremely relaxed, and the procedure should be virtually pain-free. If you have general anesthesia, which is a type of IV sedation that puts you to sleep completely, you won’t feel or experience anything during the procedure—you’ll simply wake up and it will be over. Sedation generally costs extra.

<b>Why This Year Matters More Than Ever</b><br><br>
As we prepare for Thanks, Birth Control Day on Wednesday, November&nbsp;15th, we reflect on how much has changed since the movement began 11&nbsp;years ago.<br><br>
Back then, Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights. Since its fall in June&nbsp;2022, we've seen bans and restrictions escalate across many states. Justice Clarence Thomas even hinted at reviewing the right to contraception. This era has created fear and uncertainty, even among long-time advocates.<br><br>

<b>Rebuilding Hope</b><br><br>
- Voters in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Vermont approved constitutional abortion rights.<br>
- Voters in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana rejected stricter abortion proposals.<br>
- Awareness of AbortionFinder.org soared.<br>
- Local abortion funds received widespread support.<br>
- The FDA approved the first over-the-counter birth-control pill, increasing accessibility.<br><br>

<b>Let’s Make Some Noise This Year</b><br><br>
Now more than ever, we must act. Share your story. Educate others. Demand change from elected leaders. Every action matters in the fight for reproductive freedom.<br><br>
Campaigns like <b>#ThxBirthControl</b> are essential. Our health, future, and freedom depend on it.<br><br>

<b>How You Can Support #ThxBirthControl and Reproductive Freedom</b><br><br>

<b>1. Share Your Story</b><br>
Speak up about why birth control matters to you. Use <b>#ThxBirthControl</b> on social media. Discuss reproductive rights with friends and family. Your story has the power to inspire and normalize these critical conversations.<br><br>

<b>2. Contact Your Representatives</b><br>
Let your lawmakers know you support:<br>
- Improved insurance coverage for contraception<br>
- Increased family-planning funding<br>
- Protection of abortion access<br><br>
Call or email them. Share your values and urge them to back reproductive-rights legislation.<br><br>

<b>3. Donate or Volunteer</b><br>
Support organizations like <b>Power to Decide</b>. Your donations help sustain platforms like Bedsiderr.org and AbortionFinder.org.<br><br>
Prefer giving your time? Volunteer at a local abortion clinic, possibly as an escort.<br><br>

<b>4. Vote in Every Election</b><br>
Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in every election—federal, state, and local.<br><br>
Make sure you're registered. Vote. Encourage others to vote. Local leaders have a big impact on access to care in your community.<br><br>

<b>Together, We Can Make a Difference</b><br><br>
Through collective action—whether by voting, donating, volunteering, or simply telling our stories—we can protect reproductive rights and expand access to birth control.<br><br>
<b>Our future depends on it.</b>

<b>One Year Since Roe v. Wade Was Overturned</b><br><br>
It’s hard to believe, but tomorrow marks one year since Roe v. Wade was overturned.<br><br>

<b>What Was Roe v. Wade?</b><br><br>
Roe v. Wade was the 1973 landmark case that established the constitutional right to abortion and vastly improved access to abortion across the country. But on June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe, opening the door for state legislators to limit or eliminate abortion access in their states.<br><br>

<b>The Impact Over the Past Year</b><br><br>
It’s easy to feel discouraged and angry watching one state after another ban or severely limit abortion. The ripple effect is still ongoing. States continue to pass laws restricting access.<br><br>

<b>What We're Doing</b><br><br>
At AbortionFinder, our sister site, we’ve continued fighting to help people find abortion providers, get financial support, and stay informed about state laws. And we’re not stopping.<br><br>

<b>Here’s How You Can Help</b><br><br>

<b>1. Donate to AbortionFinder</b><br>
Donating to Power to Decide (our parent site) helps us keep AbortionFinder going and support increased access to abortion. Every amount counts.<br><br>

<b>2. Tell a Friend</b><br>
If you know someone who needs an abortion—especially in a restricted state—tell them about AbortionFinder.org. Share the link with three friends. You never know who might need it.<br><br>
<b>3. Buy AbortionFinder Merch</b><br>
Show your support and spread awareness by purchasing merch like our tote bag. Check out the store for more items to wear proudly.<br><br>

<b>4. Post on Social Media</b><br>
We’ve made it easy. Just share one of our graphics and tag @AbortionFinder. Your post helps raise awareness and support the fight.<br><br>

<b>5. Enter Our Giveaway</b><br>
Visit our Instagram to enter our giveaway for a chance to win an “Abortion Positive” hat, tote, and pin set. Share with a friend too!<br><br>

<b>6. Spread the Word About Local Abortion Funds</b><br>
Visit your state’s page on AbortionFinder to locate local abortion funds. Share their work so they can continue helping those in need.<br><br>

<b>Keep Fighting</b><br><br>
There’s still a long road ahead, and we need your help. Don’t give up—we certainly won’t.

Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to abortion and, in so doing, vastly improved access to abortion across the country. But on June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade.

We will certainly cry this weekend (and probably also scream), but today, in defiance of those who have celebrated taking away one of our most precious rights, we have chosen to lift up the voices of those who have benefited from access to abortion.`
